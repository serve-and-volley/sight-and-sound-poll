We love films neither for the reproduction of real life nor for the entertainment, but for the appearance of the human being. 
Rashomon shows us impossibility of understanding the world and the inability of discovering the truth – those are, at first sight, European existential values, but they were brought to cinema by its Eastern film director.
Everything became possible in cinema because Wild Strawberries appeared. Again, I choose it not for the entertainment purposes, but as a reflection of fantasies and human imagination. 
Le Notti di Cabiria has absolute genuineness and an attachment to human soul. Neorealism, in my opinion, is the basis of cinema as art. 
Land of Fathers is one of the best Soviet films of the ‘Thaw’ period. It has not gained worldwide audience because distributing Kazakh films was prohibited during Soviet times. The dialogue of civilisations, an examination of archetypes, finding yourself and your roots – all of these are in the film. 
“Human needs human” – this is Goethe’s phrase as said by Snaut in Solaris, a film of psychologism, philosophy, aesthetic film language and direct emotions. 
Gabbeh is a cinematographic anthem of love, nature and life. The story is set in ‘heaven on earth’; its director brought primordial beauty to love. 
Beshkempir: The Adopted Son displays the Central Asian mentality in contemporary film language. For me, this is the first film that revived my childhood feelings and emotions. 
The Matrix is a bright image of Buddhist duality and an imaginary replica of the people of the western hemisphere; Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring…, meanwhile, also reflects Bhuddist philosophy in the bright visual images and in its portrayal of the path that a human being takes in overcoming himself.
This is the reflection of Bhuddist philosophy in the bright visual images and reflection of the path that human being is undertaking in overcoming himself.

I could easily have put in another two each for Bresson and Tarkovsky, it felt like betrayal to leave out several of Kieslowski's and a couple of Fellini's (La Strada in particular which had a big effect on my development as a filmmaker), and there are some more recent films which perhaps would be on the list if I'd had more time to live with them."

I believe they are very close to the definition of ‘artistic perfection’ – or my definition of it, at least. Some of them might not be historically important but I’m sure most inspired numerous filmmakers in many ways. Besides, I think the directors of these ten films succeeded in using film grammar not only to tell a story but also as a way of understanding modern society and human psychology. I also have to mention that those directors achieved their general artistic goals flawlessly."

I had more than 35 films on that list. Most of them I watched for the first time on video cassette in the years immediately after my dad brought home a VCR in 1986. Before that moment I hardly watched a film at all.
I can’t remember why, or how it got into my head, but I always imagined Jean-Luc Godard was cool from a young age, and when I saw Band à part I was finally proved right. It’s packed with perfect screen moments: the run through the Louvre; the hypnotic dance sequence, which I once tried to recreate when performing for some friends; and of course two guys and a girl.
I’ll never forget Dennis Hopper scaring the shit out of me to Roy Orbison’s In Dreams in Blue Velvet, or how beautiful Isabella Rossellini seemed, even as I watched through the slits of my fingers. It remains the only film that can still send chills down my spine no matter how many times I see it.
Do The Right Thing was the film to see when I was 15. It had all the things that seemed to affect my life at the time: racism, music and a desire for cool trainers. It defined the era and introduced me to New York. I’ll even admit that the first time I saw it I was too young to really appreciate how good it is, and of course it was the film that got me intrigued by Spike Lee.
It’s only one moment in Oliver Hirschbiegel’s Downfall, yet Bruno Ganz’s performance as Hitler is so brilliant in showing his disgust at the failure of Steiner to attack the allies that the scene has been used and abused by legions of internet users around the world, replacing the orignal subtitles to comment on current affairs – it’s the gift that won’t stop giving. My favourite iteration is Plankhead’s 2010 version of the scene, about the reaction to the scenes being removed from the internet: it shows a complete corporate misunderstanding of how audiences were helping to bring an arthouse German film to worldwide attention. Of course, changing the subtitles is an old joke – mistranslations have been a staple of comedians for years – but it doesn’t stop the original internet mash-up from being funny and is probably the single scene I’ve watched the most in the last decade. For that alone it makes the list.
There are so many reasons I love La dolce vita that I don’t know where to start – my friends calling me Marcello after a particular successful night out in Italy is definitely the most personal and worst of them. More pertinently, it has the greatest performance from my favourite actor of all time.
Pakeezah was the one film in my parents’ catalogue of Indian films that I would watch happily time and time again as a youngster. I didn’t even realise how great it was until I saw some other Bollywood hits and became better versed in musicals from all over the world. For the soundtrack alone (which I regularly play on my iPhone) it would get into any ‘best of’ lists; add to that its perfect dance sequences, a heartbreaking melodramatic tale of family strive and the perfect depiction of how nurture can outdo nature, and before you can sing ‘Chalo Dildar Chalo’ I’m investing in the dreams of a prostitute.
It was hard to choose one Alfred Hitchcock film but Psycho was the first one that I saw, and for that alone it beats out Vertigo, Rear Window and North by Northwest. It’s simply too hard to choose between them on anything but irrational grounds.
Films and sport are two of my greatest loves but sadly the combination on the silver screen usually gives me the same sense of sadness I get when watching Fulham lose at Craven Cottage. Raging Bull avoids all the sporting clichés that usually make sporting movies a bore. It tells the story of two brothers who don’t know whether to love each other or hit each other – De Niro and Pesci at their electrifying best.
Someone once said to me that it’s odd if Sweet Smell of Success makes you want to be a journalist – if only I had realised that the reality it would be all the hassles without the power. Alexandra Mckendrick is probably one of the world’s most underrated directors. 
The Outsiders is not even Francis Ford Coppola’s best film, yet it’s the movie I’ve seen the most times, and I can probably still quote every line. How much I wanted to be Dallas Winston. Matt Dillon seemed so cool. Alas, they do say, one should never meet your heroes.

Marcelo Alderete,364,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/364,programmer,Argentina,Male,critics poll,"Programmer, Mar de Plata International Film Festival",10,"Choosing the best ten films in history produces a feeling of distress similar to that when you attend a film festival: the offer is just too vast. You can do it in the simplest way, choosing the ones you feel are the best films – always, in our own opinion, following a logical and unappealable criteria, but fanciful and incomprehensible to everyone else. Another possibility is to impose certain rules. Personally, I’ve always believed in choosing those films that, as Serge Daney said, saw me grow up. Or to express it in another way, films that grew up with me.
In the mid-1970s Argentineans found their cinematographic education in neighborhood movie theatres with their double-features; cinephilia came to me together with the Video Club explosion during the 1980s. I was part of Generation VHS and, for the first time, film history was available to anyone. The old guardians of cinephilia saw their ancient, secret knowledge tested by young people who consumed non-stop every film that fell into their hands. Low-budget horror films, classics films… whatever. Part of this list comes from that ignoble place – perhaps not actual film choices, but a certain atmosphere.
By the mid-1990s, TV cathode rays had defined the cinephilia of a generation, just as film festivals were reborn in our country. Film festivals: another place where films became more democratic, where many movies that did not reach commercial distribution (almost always the best ones) were, at least for a while, available to all audiences. And from here comes another restriction to this list: to choose only films that I have seen, at least once, in movie theaters.
The last rule I followed to get to my final ten films comes from Corto Maltés’ ‘The Ballad of the Salty Sea’: “To remain in the past, as you do, is like guarding a graveyard.” As nobody wants – I think – to have that task, I tried as hard as I could to move away from the past, or to keep it present as a kind of tool that will help me to better understand the future.
“Every rule wants to destroy its exception,” Jean-Luc Godard said. This list is born from that struggle among rules and exceptions.

That’s a stretch, but these are all films that have enjoyed an extended life both in the film culture at large and in my own mind, from the first time I saw them until today. What runs through all these films is the sheer pleasure of exploring the expressive possibilities of the medium. The predominant mood seems to be sadness and the spirit of noir hovers over many of them without definitively settling on a single title. Last week I might have chosen other films, tomorrow I could choose a different set, but I suspect that they would all share these characteristics."

What I think all of them have in common is that now, looking back, they all seem to be the extreme expressions of artistic projects have been aborted by history and that remain abandoned mysteries, like a time capsule that can tell us as much about the future as it can show us about the past.

I know it’s always been difficult to narrow one’s list down, but we have so many more great films to choose from now. While it’s crucial to acknowledge work of the most recent decades, wouldn’t it be absurd to remove, say, His Girl Friday (the greatest talkie comedy made in black and white?) in order to make space for The Big Lebowski (the greatest talkie comedy made in colour?), or to replace Tokyo Story with A One and a Two, L’Atalante with Beau Travail, Ordet with The White Ribbon. Those were some of the impossible choices I was faced with; as it was, I had to leave out altogether (the agony!) Stroheim, Lang, Renoir, Hitchcock, Mizoguchi, Ophuls, Demy, Altman and Malick, while face-offs like those between Au hazard Balthazar and The Son, Journey to Italy and The Travelling Players, Listen to Britain and Land of Silence and Darkness, Once upon a Time in America and Once upon a Time in Anatolia never really got a look-in. I compromised.
That said, I stand by my final ten (today, at least), and there’s one point I want to make: though I’ve always voted for Welles in such polls, this is the first time I’ve opted for Citizen Kane. I used to be a bit perverse about it, preferring the warmth of The Magnificent Ambersons, the B-movie bravura of Touch of Evil, the mischievous magic of F for Fake. But in the last decade, even more than before, I’ve watched this first feature many times, and each time, it reveals new treasures. Clearly, no single film is the greatest ever made. But if there were one, for me Kane would now be the strongest contender, bar none.

By the same rules I could very easily have been happy with wall-to-wall Hitchcock, Powell or mid-period Woody Allen. In the name of diversity I have added a few other directors and, given that I know of no useful measure of greatness, I worked largely by the pleasure principle. I have watched each of these films repeatedly for decades. Each time I watch them they surprise with new meanings or details that I had failed to spot in the past. Even writing down their names makes me want to turn on the DVD player as soon as I get home.
If, howver, I was eschewing notions of greatness and my list was wholly determined by the number of times I have watched a film it might have looked rather more like this: Parkgate Iron and Steel Co., Rotherham (Mitchell and Kenyon, 1901); N or NW (Len Lye, 1937); English Harvest (Jennings, 1938); Kiss Me Kate (Sidney, 1953); Land of the Pharaohs (Hawks, 1955); Imitation of Life (Sirk, 1959); Snow (Jones, 1963); Zulu (Endfield, 1964); Fahrenheit 451 (Truffaut, 1966) and Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (Demy, 1967).

Only ten! Impossible. I’ve had to leave out so many excellent films, so many excellent directors from the silent period, or people like John Ford, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder (my heroes), Orson Welles (yes, I am afraid I am not going to include Citizen Kane, although it is indeed a great film), Dassin’s Rififi, Truffaut, Fellini, Woody Allen (Annie Hall!), Ozu or Kurosawa, without forgetting “all those bright young men and women” from the former Eastern Europe: Wajda, Munk, Kieslowski, Forman, Menzel, Chytilová, Szabo, Meszaros, the Soviet filmmakers. And Tarkovski; and Buñuel. And the list can go on and on and on and on. As a film historian I should give an objective list covering the key moments in the history of cinema, but I am, above all, a spectator, so, I am afraid, this list is a rather personal one. So… Not only was L’Arrive d’un train en gare one of the first films to have a proper audience, but it also does not matter how many times I watch it, I still find it mesmerising. Any of Chaplin’s silent films could have received the vote. Anyway, I am not going to go for City Lights or any of his features, but for one of his two-reelers at the Mutual, The Rink. I have The Last Laugh as I feel it is not only Murnau’s best film but also because it is one the pinnacles of the silent period in terms of developing a purely visual language. With L’avventura Antonioni went back to the silent masters by using dialogue sparsely and developing a different type of story, supported by the visuals and sounds. I could have also chosen La Notte (1960) or L’eclisse (1962). Nothing really happens in Intimate Lighting, just two old friends meeting and catching up after so many years. Perfect. Persona is the best example of what Béla Balázs termed as the ‘dimension of physiognomy’. Together with Nykvist, Andersson and Ullman, Bergman explores the soul behind the mask. In My Night with Maud, Eric Rohmer meets Nestor Almendros meets Jean-Louis Trintignant meets Françoise Fabian… The Spirit of the Beehive displays Erice’s mastery when it comes to developing a dialogue between the spectator and the filmmaker: he makes the spectator a participant of the creative process or, to paraphrase his words, he encourages the spectator to experience the same path down which the director has previously walked. And Luis Cuadrado’s cinematography is stunning. The Conversation is one of those before-and-after films; Walter Murch experiments with sound design. I have to include a more contemporary film, otherwise I would be one of those grumpy old men who thinks cinema is dead, so 2046 is it. Wong Kar Wai is one of the greatest filmmakers in terms of knowing, absorbing, blending and developing the hundred and so odd years of cinema."

I’ve recently (re)saw Metropolis (the restored version, at the Transilvania International Film Festival in 2010) with live and very modern, industrial-sounding music performed by Antonio Bras – the efect was astonishing: eveything that cinema means was there: editing, tension, (melo)drama, acting, music… everything!

I don’t know why I choose these films: the best films are in the thousands and I don’t really believe that life is a hierarchical system, but rather a collective one. So maybe, for me, a fragment of a film is more important that the corpus of a famous filmmaker.
Anyway, if I’m now involved in the ‘cinema du réel’ (I don’t like the word ‘documentary’ – it’s too ambiguous and often used to depict a minor genre, mostly for television) it’s because in my past films that revealed the astonishment of the truth (I don’t talk about the truth of plot, information or a speech, but the truth of living bodies, of an action, of emotion) are connected to the reality, Also if they are the result of a complete manipulation (as – we know it – every form of art is). They are also, in some cases, the fruit of a challenge where we see at the same time a creative mind at work, a filmmaker’s faith in his project, the intimate necessity to do it, the respect for the spectator as an intelligent being. 
Finally, I probably chose them because they revealed something closely connected to my own intimate reality. I belong to a generation who was born in the 1950s – that’s why you don’t find any new film in my list.

I would choose all his films but I think that he has been especially marvelous in City Lights, a romantic love story about a tramp and a blind woman.
 I love all the movies of Fellini for their strange and baroque atmosphere. But I’ll choose Otto e Mezzo because of its poetic aesthetic. The story of lonely filmmaker Guido Anselmi, lost in his memories and dreams, is very beautiful. I love the mix between fantasy and reality, the black-and-white scenes and the foolish narration of Fellini. It’s a fantastic, artistic movie.
I have a great admiration for Pier Paolo Pasolini. I can say that he is really a global artist. He was poet, writer, journalist and film director. I think that Salo is his most violent and most radical movie, in which he explores the links between political corruption and sexual perversion. The narrative structure of the film is amazing. We must remember that it was the last movie Pasolini made before his assassination.
I’m very interested by the situation of autistic persons and I’ve been very touched by the role hold by Dustin Hoffman in Rainman as Raymond Babbitt. He was absolutely incredible as this character.
As a playwright, I know what it means for an actor to be on stage and to hide his feelings and troubles when he is in the skin of a character. Opening Night shows with a great skill the dark side of the theatre, and Gena Rowlands is phenomenal in the role of Myrtle Gordon, this big Broadway star who must continue to act, despite the horror of the scene she has witnessed.
Taxi Drives sees a big, big, big, unforgettable Robert de Niro brilliantly directed by a big, big Martin Scorsese in a very tough psychological thriller – one of the best of his kind.
 Contempt is a beautiful opus to Nouvelle Vague cinema, and one of Godard’s most experimental movies. I love his troubled and troubling narration, his obsession with breaking the codes of popular cinema using some typical Godardian tropes: minimal dialogues with strange gestures, stares and situations. It’s intellectual as usual but also aesthetically different and courageous. 
The Passenger is one of Antonioni’s best movies, especially with its famous last sequence: a seven-minute-take tracking shot around the hotel where David Locke (John Nicholson) is dead.
The most spectacular performance of Tom Cruise’s career as is in Born on the Fourth of July as Ron Kovic, a veteran of the Vietnam War who goes home in a wheelchair and begins a new struggle against the politics of the United States in Vietnam.
In the west, people know almost nothing about Algerian cinema but Inland is the best movie ever made in my country. It’s a film about the effects of the civil war in the deep countryside, a very beautiful road movie with fantastic scenes and a radical aesthetic.

Paolo Bertolin,228,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/228,programmer,Italy,Male,critics poll,"Consultant, Venice International Film Festival",10,"Rather than trying to choose the most important or best films in the history of cinema as a whole – a demanding challenge I don’t feel at ease facing – I preferred to concentrate on the films that molded, influenced and reshaped my perception of and passion for cinema since the time I started developing a specific interest for Asian films, in the second half of the 1980s.
I thus could not help but pay full tribute to Hou Hsiao-hsien’s Taiwan Trilogy, not only for its aesthetic triumph, but because it provides the defining example of cinema used as an active tool to relate and rewrite the history of a country through the histories of its people – imagined or real. A Petal, Jang Sun-woo’s cinematic exorcism of the Kwangju Massacre, and Evolution of a Filipino Family, Lav Diaz’s torrential epic of the martial law years in the Philippines, rightfully belong to this cinematic lineage too, as does Jia Zhangke’s portrait of youth at the time of China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation.
Tsai Ming-liang’s quietly heartbreaking account of contemporary anomie and urban alienation Viva l’Amour! and Tropical Malady, Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s positively queer exploration of film as a space of osmosis, contagion and shape shifting, attest recognisably idiosyncratic (and unavoidably trendsetting) cinematic visions.
Imamura Shohei’s deeply humanistic and rigorous remembrance of the harrowing fate of those who survived the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, Black Rain, stands as one of the grandest condemnations of the horrors of war through art.
Finally, in an exception to the Asian canon (and to the expense of Stanley Kwan’s ghost melodrama Rouge, which I originally shortlisted), I include Marco Bellocchio’s brilliant masterwork My Mother’s Smile, a film where nightmares are dreamt with eyes wide open but monsters are eventually chased away by the awakening of reason.

Visconti is sorely missed, as are very personal favourites like Franju’s Les yeux sans visage and Vigo’s L’Atalante. All I can hope for is that the spirit of these absent films lurks somewhere among the films chosen. As for what guides the choices, I feel that until now most good cinema has come from outside those cultural conventions that we call ‘western’ – from where the medium has forever been welcomed as a magical visitor from nowhere. The films chosen here best live up to the wildly experimental and playful ways in which cinema was meant to be engaged with."

This meant excluding all films by Bergman, Coppola, De Sica, Donen, Eisenstein, Fellini, Ford, Godard, Hitchcock, Kelly, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lean, Murnau, Ozu, Renoir, Scorsese, Welles or Wilder. Some exclusions, of course, were painful. Then, though I was tempted to seek certain balance and variety (I am not pleased at the evident cultural and chronological concentration of the list), I stuck to a term suggested in the invitation to vote, “impact”, and assumed the utter subjectivity of the exercise.

In The Truman Show, Peter Weir displays the operation and background of quiz shows, presented through excellent performances.
Croupier also examines the rules of a profession – and not the same as the statutory laws. One of Clive Owen’s best performances.

These films cover the landmarks of our travels in the continent of cinema in the Calcutta of the 1980s-90s. They range from the celebration of the everyday Indian reality in Ray and the encounter with history in Ghatak to the lasting spirit of Soviet montage, the discursive flight to poetry in the Nouvelle Vague, the explosive mix of disparate traditions in Japan, the commitment to the unconscious in Buñuel and the revival of faith in the cinema in Kiarostami.

The Holy Mountain, Eraserhead and The Falls push auteurism to ecstatically unhinged extremes, along the way defying all definition. Apocalypse Now and Koyaanisqatsi expand the possibilities of cinematic sound and spectacle to unfold grand narratives in innovative ways. La Dolce Vita captures (in tabloid snapshot) the ambivalence of the modern age by exulting in the very decadence and excess that it also decries, while the time-serving antihero of Assassination is a slippery avatar for any era of shifting allegiances and identities. All of these films are amenable to, and indeed benefit from repeated watchings, maturing along with the viewer, while several also offer a near-encyclopedic vision of life in cross-section. Of course many, many other titles would meet these criteria – but if these ten are not perhaps the greatest films (whatever that might mean), each at least offers a template of greatness."

I am teaching international film history and have studied these films. Many of them do represent the aesthetic pinnacles of achievement, but in a strange way my admiration for Welles, Renoir and Eisenstein remains purely cognitive. The ten films in my list had the biggest impact on my view of cinema as an artform, as a means for directorial self-expression, in essence a cinema of auteurs that moved me on an intellectual and emotional level.

Thus, a provisional list that I dedicate to André Sauvage’s Dans la brousse annamite (1934), a film abominably mutilated by the industry, which is about a possible trace of paradise on earth.
Alongside Balle traversant une bulle de savon I choose all the plates, strips and films by Thomas Edison, Eadweard Muybridge, Etienne-Jules Marey, Lucien Bull and Georges Demeny; the scientific films by Docteur Comandon, Jean Painlevé, Maurice Françon, Alexis Martinet, Yves Berthier; all films that are in slow motion, beginning with Raymonde Carasco’s Gradiva; and all films less than a minute long that invented a new way to describe the world.
Beside Nothing But the Hours I choose other films on the history of cinematic forms, which invented their own ways of deepening the images: Al Razutis’ Visual Essays, Ken Jacobs’ Tom Tom the Piper’s Son and all of Ken Jacob’s work, Kirk Tougas’s The Politics of Perception, Jean-Luc Godard’s Histoire(s) du Cinéma; the films of Dziga Vertov, the Dziga Vertov Group, the Cintéhique Group, Harun Farocki, Hartmut Bitomsky, Andrei Ujica, Carolee Schneeman, Rui Simoes, Michael Klier, Jayce Salloum, Thom Andersen, Tony Cokes, William E. Jones, Marc Tribe, Mauro Andrizzi…
By the Bluest of Seas – and those films in which the sea shines, beginning with Jean Epstein’s Breton films (L’Or des mers, Finis Terrae, Mor’Vran...), moving through Stan Brakhage (A Child’s Garden & the Serious Sea), Gérard Courant (A propos de la Gréce), Ange Leccia & Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (Ile de Beauté), Peter Hutton’s films; all the films that discover new ways of describing landscapes, such as those of Lumiére, Masao Adachi’s a.k.a Serial Killer, Jean-Marie Straub & Daniéle Huillet Too Early Too Late, Wang Bing’s West of the Tracks…
Afrique 50 – and the counter-information and activist films by Joris Ivens, René Vautier, Chris Marker, the Newsreel, Cine-Giornali, Emile de Antonio, Edouard de Laurot, Fernando Solanas & Octavio Getino, Guillermo Escalon, the Groupe Medvedkine, Anand Patwardhan, Carole & Paul Roussopoulos, Lech Kowalski, John Gianvito and so many collectives all over the world; the re-enactment of images impossible to document, such as Herbert J. Biberman’s Salt of the Earth; plus all those that hurl their rage or their sorrow at exploitation (Les Maitres Fous by Jean Rouch, Vite by Daniel Pommereulle, Ali au pays des merveilles by Djouhra Abouda and Alain Bonnamy).
Aguaespejo Granadino – and those films that invented their own tools and devices: Abel Gance, Michael Snow’s Wavelength, films by Karel Doing, Joost Rekveld, Jérôme Schlomoff, Jacques Perconte, all films made without a camera, without money but with genius, from Len Lye to David Matarasso by way of Maurice Lemaître, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Cécile Fontaine.
Adebar – and the structural and metrical films by Peter Kubelka, Paul Sharits, Malcolm Le Grice, Peter Gidal, Mike Dunford, Wilhelm and Birgit Hein, Peter Tscherkassky, Siegfried Frufhauf etc; and all those films in which bodies are dancing shadows, from Emile Cohl and Georges Méliés to Lotte Reiniger, from Gjon Mili to John Woo (in his Hong Kong period), from C.T Dreyer’s Vampyr to Ronald Nameth or Patrice Kirchhofer.
London 66’-67’ – and all those films whose makers are also musicians and poets (Jonas Mekas, Ana Hatherly, Maurisio Kagel, Pierre Clémenti, F.J. Ossang, Marc & Eric Hurtado); those whose auteurs do the music themselves (Selva by Maria Klonaris); and those created on the basis of a song or piece of music (such as Alberto Cavalcanti’s P’tite Lilie, Dimitri Kirsanov’s The Cradle, Anthony’s Stern’s San Francisco).
Two Lane Blacktop – and all those films that create their own world in the name of amour fou, by Buster Keaton, Tod Browning, Jean Vigo, Robert Bresson, Marcel Hanoun, John Cassavetes, Chantal Akerman; Jacques Rivette’s eponymous contribution; Pakeezah by Kamal Amrohi; Green Snake by Tsui Hark; Tabu by Nagisa Oshima; plus those by Peter Emanuel Goldman, Jean Eustache, Philippe Garrel, Christian Boltanski, R.W. Fassbinder, P.P. Pasolini, Philippe Grandrieux, Abel Ferrara, Patricia Mazuy, Virginie Despentes et Coralie Trinh-Ti, Jia Zhang Ke, Larry Clark, Gus Van Sant, Vincent Gallo.
Timeless, Bottomless, Bad Movie – and those films exploding and reassembling the cinematic forms with such energy that they remain unique, seeming fireworks of the real, such as those by Teinosuke Kinugasa, Luis Buñuel, Jean Vigo, Mario Peixoto, Santiago Alvarez, Peter Watkins, Lionel Soukaz, Toshio Matsumoto, Masanori Oe, Djibril Diop Mambéty, Jia Zhang-ke, Cheick Oumar Sissoko.
Profit & Nothing But! Or Impolite Thoughts on the Class Struggle – and those films that are not about war but are rather themselves at war, trying to become tools and instructions for fighters: S.M. Eisenstein’s The Strike, Holger Meins’ Cocktail Molotov, Masao Adachi’s The Red Army/FPLP, Declaration of World War, Jean-François Richet’s Ma 6-T va crack-er, Kinji Fukasaku’s Battle Royale; those films that were not made by ‘professional’ filmmakers but rather by citizens, such as October in Paris by Jacques Panijel (1962) or Douglas Bravo by George-Henri Mattei (Venezuela, 1970).

Of the rest, the Pontecorvo is the greatest and still the most uncannily relevant political film of the last half-century (my generation’s Potemkin), the Vlacil the most convincing excursion into an utterly alien past (something cinema can do uniquely well in the right hands), the Wong the most erotically tantalising (ditto), the Gance the most undeservedly neglected of cinema’s supreme masterpieces, and the Lozinski one of the least known in the first place, since it’s a 40-minute documentary that’s been little seen outside its native country and specialist festivals.

The mise-en-scene is so deeply layered, and the script and editing went through so many rewrites and reshuffles, that Blade Runner remains an exceptionally complex, dense and rich film, repaying multiple viewings and intense, forensic examination. Is it messy? Maybe. But humans are messy creatures.
Touch of Evil’s first shot has more skill, verve, suspense and spectacle than most films offer in their entire running time.
Breathless is irresistibly fresh, sexy, unpredictable and smart, 50 years on. 
Star Wars is perhaps not a great film in itself, but it’s about great film. It distils the best moments of cinema from its inception until 1977 – samurai, Westerns, The Wizard of Oz – and repackages them in a raw, thrilling best-of compendium, a pure hit that a generation would never forget.
For all its ugly moments, The Searchers is a beautiful film: epic, grand and moving, like ‘the turning of the earth’.
West Side Story’s opening sequence draws you into its world, and its rules of realism and performance – a New York where gang members sing their arguments and high-kick down stage avenues in bright costumes against Technicolor skies – and sells it without question. More powerful, more stirring and dynamic than 50 action films.
Tron is about the videogame culture of its time, and about the future those games and that technology would bring; it opened a window onto the visual spectacle of contemporary CGI and the camera CG-Eye. But it is also about the thrill of ‘new media’ in a broader sense: its monochrome computer world, with pale-faced, dark-eyed figures, recalls early cinema. 
Vertov’s film Man With A Movie Camera is a cut-up love letter from cinema to the city, all cities, any city – a historical document and a vision of the future, spliced and stuck back together.
Cinema should never forget that it’s inherently a teenage thing. It’s the culture of the drive-in, the date; it’s allowed to be gauche and naive, to try to be cool, to go through stupid fashions and hopeless crushes. The Breakfast Club – once entirely of its moment – now seems nostalgic, closer to Rebel Without A Cause than the present day, but it is all the more poignant and painful for the passing of time.

So picking ten film titles is for me only a way of picking ten directors. Most of these films could have been substituted by other titles from the director’s oeuvre; thus instead of Psycho, it might have been Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest. In choosing just ten directors, I feel guilt at leaving out so many who have given me so much pleasure: Buñuel, Chabrol, Coppola, Cukor, Kubrick, Malick, Minnelli, Wilder.

	Eniaios is made up of 22 sections, which, when printed in their entirity, will run for approximately 80 hours. Since Markopoulos’ death in 1991, his companion and heir, filmmaker Robert Beavers, has been printing it whenever possible, but only a handful of the film’s sections, or ‘Orders’, have yet been shown. I have seen all of Order II and Order V, and about half of Order III. Any one of them alone would be at the top of my list, so on faith I list the entire film. My inclusion of India is based on the Cinémathèque Française print I viewed in 1970, which had reasonably good colour. I don’t get much from the recent restoration. If the new print is all that will ever be shown, I would list Rossellini’s The Messiah instead. I constructed my list by first determining my favorite filmmakers, and then limiting myself to one film by each. My criteria have been entirely aesthetic. The focus in such lists on the value of individual films as separated from their makers’ oeuvres is, in my view, more than a little dubious, and is altogether too much of a piece with the object-oriented, consumerist nature of our culture. One gains much more from considering a filmmaker’s output whole, and it is considered this way that, I believe, my choices will make the most sense. Each great filmmaker uses film language in a unique way, and each film helps one learn how to see the others. A major filmmaker’s work also offers a more expansive vision than does any film taken individually. Thus I would prefer that an interested viewer see any ten films by a single filmmaker on my list rather than one by each. Mizoguchi’s Genroku Chushingura, for example, is not necessarily greater, and certainly not more emotionally affecting, than Sansho Dayu, but it has both a uniqueness and a perfection different from that found in his later films, a comparison that only becomes clear when one has seen many. Eniaios is perhaps the most purely cinematic of films. Other arts are major inspirations, to be sure, but the film itself, with its flash frames and solid blacks and whites alternating in amazingly architectural rhythms (I thought, among other things, of classical temple columns separated by sky) can stand for, and in some ways surpass, what is best about the greatest films: a rhythmically pulsating rectangle of light. It attains an all-encompassing hugeness unparalleled in any other film I know. Mizoguchi attains an ineffable spatial perfection, raising to sublimity the weight of human emotion, history and some sense of emptiness. Rossellini’s world-encompassing vision in India is unique in his work. Brakhage’s Egyptian Series attains a level of abstraction beyond even that of his ‘Romans’ and ‘Arabics’, shifting clouds of textured light conveying qualities that have no verbal equivalents. L’Argent is a terrifying mechanism, a vision of horrible inevitability, an emptying out that surpasses even other Bresson films. Schwechater, which is only one minute in length, is one of the most perfect, ecstatic and amazingly complex of constructions. Naruse’s late ‘Scope films are perhaps his greatest, being indescribably moving even while avoiding the emotionalised visual expressions of so many melodramas to instead create an unbiased openness to the world. It is hard to choose a best Hawks – his visual style seems to grow from the tiniest of character gestures to patterns of space and light that parallel the organicity of bodies in space. While Seven Women is in some ways the greatest Ford, The Sun Shines Bright combines a depth of vision with a perfection of narrative that perfectly matches Ford’s visual evocations of honour, community, memory and loss. As with most of the other films on my list, Robert Breer’s many short masterpieces have yet to receive their proper recognition, but he achieves a cinematic intensity unlike any other filmmaker, combining flicker, color, line and depth paradoxes that underline the artificiality of film space, together with a humour that underlines absurdities. The vision that he achieves is transformative."

The Grapes of Wrath is the oldest and most accomplished American road movie. The world of the tradition-bound family collapses and another one, yet difficult to define, emerges.

Chaplin’s A Woman of Paris is a fascinating experiment of blending comedy and drama that raises the understanding of human weaknesses to Shakespearean altitudes.

Instead I’ve settled on a list of films that I feel have ambition, albeit in different forms, for what cinema can be. Crucially, I think each film is largely successful in achieving what it sets out to do – isn’t that the biggest challenge in filmmaking? 
A couple of notes: To the nine full-length heavyweights I add Chuck Jones’ Road Runner movie Beep Beep – a clichéd contrast perhaps, but I find it hard to consider nearly 120 years of cinema without acknowledging animation. Beep Beep features an extended sequence where the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote enter a tunnel wearing miners’ helmets and continue their perennial chase as onscreen dots of light. Jones manages to wring out the gags from these two dots – a great instance of pure cinema. Also, I must slightly pedantically point to Playtime’s gauge – 70mm – to signify that the full scale and ambition of Tati’s film is best appreciated on that size or equivalent theatrical projection.

But I chose the above ten for yet more reasons: they embody as much of what cinema is, as I see possible; they make up whole worlds, explain who we are, question the sense of existence (or laugh it in the face); they taught me cinema, made me love the movies more than I had before.

There are some films that are established as landmarks in my memory and in my heart (La règle du jeu, To be or Not to Be) because of their structure and the way they mix comedy and tragedy – they are not classic but always at the cutting edge. They should be in every list! 
There are films I have a very strong relation with (Sunrise, Viaggio in Italia, The Mother and the Whore), which became part of my life and whose characters stayed with me.
There are films that are particularly relevant at this precise moment of my life (Some Come Running, Modern Times). They both deal with the body and space. They both work in term of rhythm and music. They are both so full of life that they make me laugh and cry. 
Then I added some films that explain where I came from. During my activities as film critic I devoted part of my time to animation and documentaries. So I choose one very classic animated film that is extremely powerful in terms of its realism (Graves of the Fireflies) and one documentary that is a sort of map of the 21st century (Amsterdam Global Village). 
Finally, I choose a title (Yi YI) that I saw only once at the Cannes Film Festival, yet the feeling of it remained with me powerfully throughout this last decade. I choose it as a tribute to the role of film festivals (for me, the best way to discover new and old films), as well as to the man who made the film. 
I must admit there is one film that was expelled at the last moment to let Modern Times in: Jean Vigo’s 1934 film L’Atalante (another specimen of the second group). I really hope someone else will choose it!

There’s a great deal wrong with this list: I’ve simply baulked at selecting from the riches of Hitchcock, despite becoming more and more interested in his work as a whole. Likewise Ford: how to chose from such a career (but I do feel it’s time to treat The Searchers as the obvious canonic Ford, and pay more attention to earlier work). And what about Lang (especially after seeing the magnificent restoration of Metropolis) and Renoir? And Bergman and Antonioni, both dying at the same moment: how could any self-respecting list of the ten greatest omit these?
Animation and documentaries never stand a chance in these lists, so I persist with my somewhat English choices, although there are certainly more hard-hitting documentaries than Jennings, but none so evocatively poetic. And of course there’s more ambitious animation than Len Lye’s Post Office ad, but I love its cheeky experimentation with what were then new techniques.

Roger Clarke,143,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/143,critic,UK,Male,critics poll,Critic,10,"I have an aversion to lists and a complicated relationship to the canonical. The internet is convulsed with macho and tribal criticisms of top ten and top 100 lists of this nature. Yet against my expectations I have found this to be a useful exercise. Why, for example, do I have so few American films in my top ten? I would dearly like to have added a Robert Altman film – especially Nashville and The Long Good Friday – or a good screwball comedy, probably Preston Sturges’ The Lady Eve. If I had to add an Orson Welles, it would be The Magnificent Ambersons. 
There are many others – the inevitable Renoirs and Ozus, but I prefer Bresson and Mizoguchi in each case. I would like to have included Hou Hsiao-hsien, or possibly an Eric Rohmer, especially since the soundscape of the latter’s Brittany beaches always propels me back to my childhood. Others will take care of the big beasts of 1970s cinema – Scorsese and Coppola – and I don’t feel any great need to revisit them. Someone such as Werner Herzog deserves a mention for his whole output and an outstanding contribution to film culture in general – he’s become almost a folkloric figure. Ang Lee has similarly made a great contribution for his synthesis of eastern and western sensibilities. His Wedding Banquet is one of the great modern farces.
As to my actual top ten, I have the following observations. I am aware that there is an intersection between favourite films and good films, the classic error of the amateur critic. Just because I like a film it doesn’t make it good, it just means it pushes a few buttons. In the case of Mizoguchi and Bresson I could have chosen almost any of their films. Sokurov is uneven in his output, but I still find the swoop of his Russian Ark as astounding as the first day I saw it. Choosing Pasolini’s Arabian Nights, which along with Porcile is his least-regarded film, might be seen as deliberately perverse, but it seems to me his happiest and prettiest film. Jan Švankmajer’s Alice, along with F.W Murnau’s Nosferatu, seem to have an almost occult force to them and give the sensation that they are accessing areas of imagination very few other films do. To a lesser extent, the same can be said of Lynch’s Mulholland Dr. On the other hand, Yi-Yi seems to me one of the most sublimely humane and conscious films ever made, containing no bells and whistles – the loss of Edward Yang after his early death in 2007 remains one of the greatest blows to modern cinema in recent times. His A Brighter Summer’s day was also in consideration for this top ten. 
But in general the films that mean the most to me are often films that resemble dreams or aspire to a dream state. Fanny & Alexander is an example of this. Film, especially approached in the darkness of a theatre, seems to me the nearest thing we have to a waking dream, with all the treasures and unfolding secrets that entails. I wouldn’t say these films are necessarily in an order, but I do find Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev to be a film that still enchants and intrigues. There is something about the warp and weft of his film, and its attempt to understand the nature of the votive and the creative, that seems to me cinematic poetry of the highest order."

Minnelli for slipping sadness and ambiguity into his trifle without souring the taste. Mizoguchi for the idea of cinema as penitence.

Hopper for Hollywood's most radical artefact and the ultimate ex-pat tale. Malick for transfiguring celluloid into half-conscious memories of a past life. Leone for defining 'pure cinema' with moral fearlessness and epic ambition. Miyazaki for the inclusive warmth and wonder of his imagination.

That Errol Morris’ filmic investigation into the case of death row inmate Randall Dale Adams’ saved his life by proving his innocence marks only one of The Thin Blue Line’s many achievements. Creating a new style of storytelling through both reconstruction and reflective narrative, Morris broke new ground with the presentation of both historic and non-fiction investigative filmmaking.
Shirley Clarke’s Portrait of Jason is a much too unsung masterpiece of documentary cinema. The beautifully non-intrusive approach creates a captivating and striking means to allow the viewer to directly engage in one man’s story of race and sexuality in the 1960s. 
Dr. Strangelove is the pinnacle of political satire, and one that continues to remain prophetic and relevant. A stunning performance from Peter Sellers utilises a multitude of comedic levels to create a humorous and self-devouring warning to mankind. 
Chris Marker’s use of ideas and imagery in Sans Soleil will be imitated for decades to come. His exploration and essayistic style explored new possibilities in forming narratives and the ability to immerse viewers into a different relationship between sound and image.
Do the Right Thing utilises a multitude of cinematic techniques to show a microcosm of a culture and world that hadn’t been shown on screen at the time of its release. It continues to serve as an important example of the effect of strong storytelling and technical craft in putting forward political and social issues through film.
An example of how film can act both as a vital record of a moment and as a self-reflective medium, Gimme Shelter is superbly crafted to allow audiences to not only witness the events of the Rolling Stones’ tragic Altamont concert, but also to view to the Stones’ own reaction to the events. By turning the medium on itself, Gimme Shelter creates a comment only on the culture of the time and on the recollection and the reaction of cinema.
Maintaining its allure to this day, Man with a Movie Camera stands witness to an evolution of cinema as it happened. The curiosity of the filmmaker radiates through every frame in its exploration of all aspects of life and cinema.
Play Time shows the beauty and power of subtlety in both cinema and comedy. The nuances of performance and craft create a world that feels like no other but whose effect is universal to audiences. 
A thriller whose use of dialogue and suspense is unparalleled, North By Northwest subdues traditional ideas of the genre to create a new style of its kind. That any number of its scenes remain iconic is a testament to Hitchcock’s incredible directing prowess. This calibre of visual style, along with the use of subtlety and tone, make North by Northwest one of the most intriguing and beguiling thrillers ever made.

I’ve chosen Tokyo Story for its subtle study of a Japanese family that discloses the culture and yet is universal. It’s an irreplaceable masterpiece of world cinema heritage.
Poetry is a film where sometimes-uncomfortable life translates into poetry – the poetry of cinema included. It also has an excellent leading performance from Yun Jung-hee.
One of the strongest Romanian New Wave films, The Death of Mr.Lazarescu reveals the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of a simple man in a society in transition. Both the ordinary man as well as the society struggle with all those quick and unavoidable changes, and find it difficult to adapt to them. 
Satantango is an artistically unforgettable experience by the Hungarian master that deals with a part of his country’s history in a very unconventional way.
For me, Whispering Pages is a superb work by a Russian master that I can only compare with those of great Russian writers. The harmony and poetry of picture and sound made my senses alert, and the film made a huge impact on development of my perception of film.
Silent Light is a film that awakens all your senses and brings them in harmony, giving you a feeling of artistic fulfilment that stays with you forever.
Surviving Life’s combination of art, philosophy, dream sequences and youth memories with poetry and ‘old-fashioned’ handmade film sees a grand master of animation displaying an artistic talent and vision with no borders.
The Wind Will Carry Us is a complex look at life through the prism of poetry created by the highly sensitive and reflective soul of Abbas Kiarostami, the great Iranian artist.
Known only to the few, In the Dark – a medium short documentary by Sergey Dvortsevoy about a blind man living in his Moscow flat together with his cat and trying to survive by making bags – is an unknown pearl of a great impact, with a lot of warmth and power. 
Amour is the ultimate study of a person’s most vulnerable period: old age and dying, during which they cope with it in an individual way. It provides an unusual insight into a taboo subject that we all prefer not to think of, but is also great cinema, with a script full of visible and invisible details.

Bicycle Thieves is neo-social realist melodrama that verges on tragedy, a document of devastated post-war Italy. Its delicate treatment of the (cinematic) space is recognised both in Bazin’s and Deleuze’s writings. Even today, stolen bicycles pass through world cinema from China to Belgium (Gamin a velo).

That makes this list somewhat nostalgic, as does the fact that these particular favourites were shot on film and not digital. I don’t hate digital, and recent features from the likes of David Fincher and David Lynch are just a few of the reasons why. But film taught me to love the movies, and it’s film that I love. It’s crushing and incomprehensible that film will vanish within my lifetime, forced into obsolescence by the greed and the shortsightedness of a movie industry that’s aided in its anti-film campaign by the unsettling indifference and ignorance of too many critics.
The movies will continue, but right now my list feels a little like a dispatch from a nearly lost world. Ask me again tomorrow, and it would certainly look a bit different. Here are some reasons why I came up with this list today: Balthazar wearing a crown of flowers and dying among the sheep. The candlelight, ‘Sarabande’ (Handel) and the ‘Women of Ireland’ (Seán O Riada) in Barry Lyndon. The camera moving across the pale faces and shadows in the opening of Flowers of Shanghai – the first of 39 shots in the film. Saint Francis shushing the birds so that God can hear him while he prays (“My little brothers, you can praise God so easily, because you’re free to fly through the air so pure.”). The parallel structure of The Godfather Part II, with Vito ascending and Michael descending; the way the young Clemenza stands pointing his gun at the silhouette of a policeman, evoking the codified gestures in silent cinema and underlining Coppola’s two other histories (the Corleone’s, cinema’s). Jack Smith in the bathtub in Little Stabs at Happiness and Ken Jacobs in voiceover (“Almost no one in this film do I see anymore”). “This wasn’t the film we dreamed of,” the doomed boy says in Masculin féminin. “This wasn’t the total film that each of us had carried within himself [sic], the film that we wanted to make or, more secretly, no doubt, that we wanted to live.” 
The cinematographer Robert Elswit said that while shooting There Will Be Blood he and director Paul Thomas Anderson looked at traditional film dailies rather than so-called digital dailies. In explaining the benefits of film dailies, Elswit provided an inadvertent explanation of why so many contemporary studio and independent movies look so bad: with film dailies “you can’t kid yourself about focus and all the other technical issues that can come back to bite you later when you go to do an IP [interpositive]. Or when you make a digital file into a negative, and you find out that those ten shots you sort of saw sharply with your D5 or HD dailies really weren’t that sharp at all. And then, of course, the color space of motion picture film is completely different than digital color space.” 
In Touch of Evil, the camera travelling across the border with both the newlywed Mr and Mrs Vargas and the blonde with “this ticking in my head”/Henry Mancini/ Charlton Heston striding across the screen like the Colossus of Rhodes and Orson Welles looming in it like a colossus of cinema/the overhead shot of Vargas driving/Dietrich lighting a cigar (evoking von Sternberg) and eulogising Hank Quinlan (suggesting Welles).

Chris Darke,724,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/724,critic,UK,Male,critics poll,Critic,10,"“Not the easiest of tasks”, warned the letter inviting me to contribute to Sight & Sound’s greatest films poll. Which proved right, but not in the way I expected. There was my preliminary longlist of strong contenders that had to be whittled down. Should I include, say, Marker’s La Jetée and Sans soleil, thereby at least giving documentary a nod? Necessary ruthlessness prevailed, uneasily. It was just as difficult to dispense altogether with Lang, Ozu, Welles, Buñuel… the list could go on. But it was an attack of what might be called ‘canon anxiety’ that confronted me with the responsibility of choice that the task entails. This was provoked by the question of which Antonioni and Godard films to choose. The standard titles would be L’Avventura and A bout de souffle; benchmark works enshrined in previous polls and therefore already canonical. That neither of the above is my favourite film by either director wasn’t why I opted for The Passenger and Histoire(s) du cinema – the work of these two filmmakers is varied enough to include new canonical contenders. So, the rerelease of The Passenger in the last decade clinched it as regards Antonioni. As for Godard’s Histoire(s), while ostensibly about cinema’s past it is also, in its extraordinary collage of forms, very much about its future. So, a modest contribution to canon reformation, I hope."

The link between my ten films is a conscious foregrounding of the mind’s processes – explored by the medium ever since its origins, and most famously by the Surrealists – which irremediably takes us back to the central tenet of Calderón de la Barca’s 1635 play Life Is a Dream.

Apart from my annual year’s best lists, this is the only list I vote in – and have done since 1972.
It’s a challenge. To add a title to the list I came up with in 2002, I must remove one. At one point in pondering this list, here’s what I thought I would do: I would simply start all over with ten new films. But it was too much like a stunt. Lists are ridiculous, but if you’re going to vote, you have to play the game. Besides, the thought of starting with a blank page and a list of all the films ever made fills me with despair. 
So I decided there must be one new film. The two candidates, for me, were Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York and Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life. Like the Herzog, the Kubrick and the Coppola, they are films of almost foolhardy ambition. Like many of the films on my list, they were directed by the artist who wrote then. Like several of them, they attempt no less than to tell the story of an entire life. In Synecdoche, Kaufman does this with one of the most audacious sets ever constructed: an ever-expanding series of boxes or compartments with which the protagonist attempts to deal with the categories of his life. The film has the insight that we all deal with life in separate segments, defined by choice or compulsion, desire or fear, past or present. It is no less than a film about life. 
In The Tree of Life, Malick boldly begins with the Big Bang and ends in an unspecified state of attenuated consciousness after death. The central section is the story of birth and raising a family. I could have chosen either film – I chose The Tree of Life because it’s more affirmative and hopeful. I realise that isn’t a defensible reasons for choosing one film over the other, but it is my reason, and making this list is essentially impossible, anyway.
Apart from any other motive for putting a movie title on a list like this, there is always the motive of propaganda: critics add a title hoping to draw attention to it, and encourage others to see it. For 2012, I suppose this is my propaganda title. I believe it’s an important film, and will only increase in stature over the years.

I would also defend each and every one of them as an awe-inspiring work of art. I looked at my 2002 list and some of the titles are different, but the overall contours are much the same: Our Hospitality instead of Sherlock Jr. for Buster Keaton, film’s greatest (and funniest) visual philosopher; the inevitable Citizen Kane, because no great movie has ever been more dynamic, ingenious and sheer fun – we shouldn’t take it for granted (last time I also had The Magnificent Ambersons on my list, a film I love as much as Kane, but I wanted to make room for other auteurs); Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon instead of 2001: A Space Odyssey because it is equally visionary and gorgeous, and perhaps slightly more poignant. Then there’s Only Angels Have Wings, which shows Hawks’ mastery of all genres in one picture: Western, adventure, romance, comedy, even musical. Trouble in Paradise is shimmering perfection – romantic comedy as rhythm and dance, dialogue as music and lyrics. Mizoguchi’s Sansho Dayu is here because, as I’ve often said, if there is a god, they are probably manifested in this movie; and Late Spring is possibly my favorite Ozu, a family tragicomedy (is there another kind?) about the sacrifices a father and daughter make for each other.
There’s a theme about men’s distrust of women that runs through Hitchcock’s Vertigo and Chinatown, and a noirish, Watergate-era cynicism that links the political/familial corruption of Chinatown with politics-as-entertainment in Nashville. 
I’m not even going to begin discussing the painful omissions. Others will have to champion films such as Sunrise (F.W. Murnau, 1927), Kings of the Road (Wim Wenders, 1976), The Night of the Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955), Playtime (Jacques Tati, 1967), The Scarlet Empress (Josef von Sternberg, 1934), Holiday (George Cukor, 1938), Miller’s Crossing & No Country for Old Men (Joel & Ethan Coen, 1990 & 2007), Letter From an Unknown Woman & The Earrings of Madame de… (Max Ophüls, 1948 & 1953), Deep End (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1970) and Fast, Cheap & Out of Control (Errol Morris, 1997).

Wise words, and keep well in mind attempting this poll response, with one proviso: let’s remove the “nearly”. The genuine torment of such assembly is made both easier and harder by a profound gap in my watching of the moving image from entire territories, a lack thrown into sharper relief when contemplating Mark Cousins’ monumental overview The Story of Film (maybe one could choose that and wrangle thousands of titles into one).
So, naming the infinite losses first; Angelopoulos, Antonioni, Brakhage, Buñuel, Egoyan, Marker, Pasolini, Paradjanov, Peleshian; Beau Travail; The Gleaners and I; Horse Thief; Old Joy; Penda’s Fen, Spirit of the Beehive; 32 Short Films about Glenn Gould; Yi Yi; comedies (especially silent, the Marx Brothers and Local Hero); the final scenes of Two Years at Sea and Werckmeister Harmonies…
However, one of many things learnt from MC Film is advocacy. All polls, of course, are endorsements, but in these volume-saturated times, maybe there’s a little more needed. Looking at my own selection, I’m struck by several things straight off – its complete failure in chronology, gender and ethnicity terms, along with an unexpected grouping within the 1970s. I can’t defend the former, but I can perhaps tease out the latter. In a way, all the works chosen explore, embody, speak for and salvage the human(e) in the face of threats and challenge on various scales. That this seam ran, delirious and wide-eyed, through that decade seems no coicidence; Utopia doesn’t disappear once it’s lost the streets. It regroups.
And there’s a sense of revelation to the titles chosen – the shock of vision in the fullest sense. It’s an auteur-driven constellation and, to a degree, these titles stand for the larger oeuvre (not the case of Tale of Tales, which is simply the greatest animation ever made – don’t take my word for it). That said, just as King Lear is the Shakespeare that speaks most urgently to our times, so it feels respectively with Stalker, 2001, The Thin Red Line.
There’s also a conscious wish to put at the centre methods of being through working (both behind and in front of the lens), hence the Watkins, the Fassbinder, the Tanner. I guess it’s about finding films that speak both to the period we live in, while pointing towards futures worth inhabiting, through how they have created realities of imagination, action and a gaze towards light, regardless of subject. That Guzman’s Nostalgia for the Light could (albeit with significant difficulty) be made now, is cause for great rejoicing.
Finally, Three Colours: Red and Wings of Desire, films so loved they have entered the psyche and are almost indivisible from it: again, film as empathy.
The fact of these all (and so many more) in the world is both a great solace and spur. Onwards!

I vowed to steer away from personal preferences when I began to compile this list, choosing titles that unequivocally deserve their place in the pantheon of the greats. At the end though, I had to cave in to my subjective predilections, setting one sole benchmark for my choices: each and every entry in my list has altered the way I see and understand not only cinema but life. 
Citizen Kane is the most perfect movie ever made – a status it deserves to uphold for many generations to come.
Bergman is cinema’s greatest filmmaker and Cries and Whispers is his ultimate statement on death, love and the human condition.
Radical in every facet, Tati’s anarchic magnum opus Play Time breaks every narrative rule, and is built on a stunning mise en scène that remains unmatched nearly half a century later. Most imperative of all, Play Time is a wondrous film that compels you to observe the world in a way you never have before.
Postmodernism found a voice in Antonioni’s revolutionary cinematic language and changed the face of arthouse cinema. The post-God world the visionary chronicler of the alienated and the disaffected valiantly confronts in L’avventura speaks of truths filmmakers have tended to ignore ever since. 
Vidor has never been given the acclaim he deserved, and The Crowd is a testament to the originality and singular vision of his work. It’s an incisive probing of the individual’s place in a mercilessly demanding society and remains as timeless as ever.
Dreyer was the first filmmaker to ask the big questions about life, God and the mysteries of the human soul, and in Ordet he delivered his most impassioned address on the elusive concept of faith.
The transience of time, the inevitability of separation and the pain of loss inform Ozu’s most compassionate, most disarmingly tender picture Late Spring.
As things grew murkier and more ambivalent following the Egyptian revolution, the one film I kept revisiting was Alea’s courageous Memories of Underdevelopment, which astutely reflects the sense of displacement in a stagnant nation lost in a purgatory of transition. 
Yang is modern cinema’s foremost humanist; his last work Yi Yi is a celebration of the joys, sorrows, triumphs and failures of characters no different than us. Amid the fear, isolation and uncertainty that defined the new century, Yang’s deeply heartfelt epic was the one of the rare places of comfort. 
The greatest of all Arab films, Chahine’s groundbreaking Cairo Station freed Egyptian cinema from the throes of melodrama, capturing the soul of a self-destructive nation drowning in a bottomless ocean of social and political malaise.

Can you make a point more cinematically than that?
Two from Minnelli (and Cyd Charisse): The Band Wagon is the sophisticated epitome of the movie musical, packed with verve, wit, fun and dazzling dancing. Brigadoon, often berated for looking like a shortbread box, is as penetrating a dramatisation of the bumpy road to love as I’ve seen. Van Johnson’s cynicism perfectly balances Gene Kelly’s swooning, the soundstage landscapes only add to the fairytale quality, and the ending defies prediction. 
Two from Robert Bolt. A Man for All Seasons has the beauty and power of an oak. It rebukes moral expediency with brilliantly crafted dialogue and acting. Its message – to be wary of fashions – makes it inescapably unfashionable, and thereby a film for all seasons. Ryan’s Daughter combines modern bite and unmatchable old-school splendour, and has my favourite end sequence of any film, a stirring mix of agony and hope. (Of the seven feature films Bolt wrote, five won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Has anyone better grasped the art of screenwriting?)
The Exorcist and The Halfway House both (in different ways) unnerve and reassure us about being spiritual animals. Shadowlands is a humane and moving tale of faith, love and loss. The Old Dark House is a supremely atmospheric hoot, and Raiders of the Lost Ark is, to my mind, cinema’s finest blast of escapism.
Directors horribly absent: Alfred Hitchcock, Preston Sturges, Roman Polanski.

Meyer’s no-nonsense exploitation classic Faster, Pussycat, Kill! Kill! is near flawless: every line of dialogue (and voiceover) a snappy, quotable snarl of contempt; MTV-editing before MTV was ever conceived of; and a truly remarkable cast – has any film had a better antihero than Tura Satana? Despite Meyer’s rep, no nudity is involved – instead, it’s Girl Power run rampant. One of the few cult classics to be even better than the fans suggest.
Made in the wake of Faces of Death, the documentary The Killing of America should be equally throwaway. Instead it’s a devastating, compulsive and apocalyptic look at American gun culture that unsurprisingly never saw release in the US. Cynical, angry and often quite disturbing, the film mixes news footage, interviews and powerful narration (written by Leonard and Chieko Schrader and voiced by Chuck Riley) to devastating effect. A masterclass in documentary making and a fascinating historical study of American life and death in the second half of the 20th century.
Alain Renais’ fascinating, ambiguous puzzle of a film, Last Year At Marienbad is one of those that lodges itself into your mind and refuses to budge. It’s a work of beauty that transcends genre and reveals something new every time.
Godard’s cynical study of marital collapse and artistic integrity – or the loss of it – Contempt is a deliciously multi-layered tale, loosely confessional and clearly personal. Brigitte Bardot is made into an object of desire, albeit an increasingly unobtainable one, while Jack Palance plays every Hollywood producer stereotype with relish. All Godard’s films of this era are great, but this is the essential one.
In Paris, Texas, Wenders and screenwriters Sam Shepard and L.M. Kit Carson created a film that blatantly tears at the heartstrings but does so within the context of a somewhat leftfield story of madness and separation – the final revelations are hardly the stuff of romantic drama. Beautiful to look at, with a perfect score by Ry Cooder and with career-best performances by Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski, it’s a film that will have the hardest-hearted viewers blubbing unashamedly more than once.
Buñuel’s biting social satire The Exterminating Angel is as pertinent as ever, losing none of its edge as it portrays how quickly civilisations collapse under pressure and how we are all trapped by social convention. It’s both terrifying and hilarious.
A masterclass in horror film making, Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre spends its first half building tension and the second half piling on the madness in a way that no other movie has ever come close to matching. You can almost taste the heat and the decay, and there isn’t a second that isn’t perfect.
One of a handful of ‘horror’ films that deal with a young girl’s loss of innocence and transition into womanhood (The Company of Wolves, Lemora: A Child’s Tale of the Supernatural), Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders is a strange, subversive, joyful, earthy fantasy with a remarkable dreamlike quality. A delight.
Woman In The Dunes is a gorgeous, unsettling tale of obsession – sexual and otherwise. Minimalist in approach but utterly absorbing, this is one of those films that burns itself into your mind on first viewing and quietly alters the way you view the art of cinema.
Narrowing down a list of the greatest films to just ten is tough – my original shortlist came to 23, and I could mount a passionate argument in favour of each title. But ten it is. And then the question is: do you choose the most important, the most artistically valid or the films you love? In the end, I’ve gone with the latter, because surely cinema should speak to us on a personal level – although I would argue that all the above films have both artistic and historical value too. These are all films I can watch continually, spotting new things and appreciating them every bit as much as I did the first time – films that I will passionately defend against detractors (and some of these films have plenty of those!) and will regularly force on to partners, houseguests and work colleagues. And, in one way or another, these are all films that changed how I saw cinema – as an artform, as a unique viewing experience, as a taboo-confronting medium and as an emotional outlet.
I’m sorry to see certain directors I love (David Cronenberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch) not represented, and I’m resigned to the fact that some people will look at this list and slowly shake their heads, appalled at my taste in film. No matter, I’ll probably do the same with theirs.

Víctor Fowler Calzada,26,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/26,critic,Cuba,Male,critics poll,Critic,10,"In my opinion, Battleship Potemkin is the greatest film ever made. All of the future search of experimentalism is contained within it. The story moves ahead in a permanent tension between novelty (in terms of style and the changes in Russian life at the time) and the big frame of history in which the action takes place.
The seeds of naturalism and the psychological exploration of human soul are present in Greed. It is full of innovations in the areas of photography, acting and the depiction of hallucinations, violence and madness. The film was made exactly at the edge of sound, announcing it and demanding its presence.
Vertigo is the perfect example of classical film style. An incredible use of symbolism throughout the fable creates a new space of intertwining reality and fiction, truth and nightmares, and immediacy and dreams; its story is based on the meaning of love and its relation to loss. And it has a perfect script, accurate like clockwork.
A narrative experiment in history told from three different (and opposed between them) points of view, truth and lies run along the story of Rashômon. It has a beautiful, powerful script and staging.
The extraordinary use of the word, the silences, the contrast of black and white, the performances hiding turbulent emotion – all these make The Word a great example of the art of cinema. A true lesson.
A Clockwork Orange abounds with invention: the irreverence, the break with convention, the use of parody and the grotesque as stylistic procedures, the cult and mockery of violence, and the insertion of elements of the mass culture. It also has a superb script, spectacular staging and unforgettable performances.
Great cinema has to be about discovery: of new cultures, of new ways of thinking, of feeling the weight of the light, of the course of time, of colour, of a means of relating a history and even of how to perform that for the screen. I believe that Yeleen is the finest example of this.
Black God, White Devil combines to great effect: the explosion of popular culture; narration; hallucinations rooted in mystic delirium; a mix of syncretic religion; magic; popular fable; epic poetry; and a deep portrait of poverty, rage and the struggle of poor people in rural areas. It is popular and avant garde at the same time.
Few works have gathered so many elements that would come to transform film narration as Breathless. Even today, we feel that Godard reinvented the art of the cinema, pushing it to the boundaries of risk and experimentation.
In The Pier we see the possible future of human race via a fable about images and imagination. A feast of stills with few seconds of moving image, it takes an incredible risk in a bet for dreams and freedom. All this in a beautiful circular story of love and memory told from the ruins.

I’ve chosen 2001 for being the only sci-fi film to present space beyond all human scale – unknowable, inhospitable and finally incomprehensible.
We require autobiographical film to open an idealised window of selective memories, and Amarcord does it better than any.
Apocalypse Now is the ultimate study of war, its immeasurable depths and its most surreal horrors. It is Catch-22 for the screen.
Hugo is pure cinema from start to finish – a summary of Scorsese’s obsessions and a love letter to film just as we say farewell to the process. Time will pronounce.
Les Demoiselles De Rochefort is the only musical that might replace Singin’ in the Rain in the poll, featuring as it does emotional joy in real locations, without guile or irony.
As much a coded warning of lost dreams, guilt and shame as a love story – Brief Encounter is gay history personified and mercifully closed.
And Your Mother Too is the only film I’ve seen that really catches the wasted freedom of being young.
Topsy-Turvy replaces 8½ as the best illustration of the creative process at work. Even low comedy can prove sublime if treated seriously.
No finer ghost story has ever been filmed than The Innocents, or one more psychologically ambiguous. It repays further visits and has the most unnerving kiss in cinema history.
With more quotable lines than any other comedy, it’s time The Producers is admitted to the pantheon. It’s worth recalling that it opened within living memory of the Holocaust.

For instance, The Son’s style thinks empathetically (using framing and movement) about a character trying to find his own empathy. The elliptical thinking of The Intruder allows the filmgoer to feel an idea of intrusion. The Second Circle almost seems to take place in the consciousness of the tired grieving son. Mauvais Sang and The Scent of Green Papaya think about love with colour. Silent Light and Stalker think meditatively about meditative living – their edits are at times profound choices. While Europa, Werkmeister Harmonies and Irreversible are just stunning feats of cinema; the latter is the most astonishingly phenomenological film of recent years, a film that breaths and pulsates through image and sound."

If pure modernism has a topos in cinema, then it has to be Bresson. Pickpocket is an amalgamation of everything that has gone before (Griffith, Chaplin, Eisenstein, Murnau, Welles) crystallised into an almost mathematically transcendental work of art. 
Mulholland Dr. is the film that, I think, responds most perfectly to the state of the human condition today. It is also a work that will show the way for many years to come.
Bergman’s Persona is uncanny. It is like a conundrum that changes every time you watch it. Hence it stands outside of time (yes, it is vampiric, if you like).
The Colour of Pomegranates is an utter synthesis of almost all modes of visual culture – an achievement that has yet to be rivalled.
When I think of the spiritual in cinema (which I do a lot, since I’m an atheist), I think of Tarkovsky’s The Mirror.
It’s probably the entire oeuvre that makes Godard so monumental and vital, but Week End remains his ultimate ‘fuck you’ and has lost none of its potency.
L’Eclisse is the best film about the apocalypse; Olympia is the flipside of the coin – utter evil realised to absolute perfection; and has there been a more influential film than Vertigo (sorry Orson)? As for Rashomon, it’s groundbreaking in so many ways – where would one start?

The criteria is as follows: films that gave me the impression of watching something really important; films that provoked a creative impulse in me, causing me either to start shooting or writing; films that I felt forced to recommend to everybody around me.
Obviously there are far more than ten films that fulfil those conditions. I guess that the obvious absences – why Grémillon and not Renoir, for instance? Why Biette and not Godard or Straub or Rohmer? Why Tourneur and not Lang or Dwan? Why Schroeter and not Fassbinder? All of them are filmmakers I deeply love – create a territory that may speak more of myself, even beyond my comprehension, while the ten films are present on the list say more, I hope, about a certain idea of cinema.
A last note on the absences: I didn’t include any Russian, Japanese or Portuguese films (among but above other nationalities) for two reasons: first, I don’t think I know those film from those countries enough; second, I had the strange feeling that if I chose a single film from any of those countries, the whole list would had to be filled with ten films from that same country. I decided to follow this principle with films from the silent period too, for the same reasons – the only silent film included is, as you may see, quite a weird choice.

Chaplin is not a comedian; he is a genius who knows to expose the essence of human existence. On the other hand, up till this point there’s never been in all the history of cinema a character as universal as Charlot, who is capable of describing human beings with shivering exactitude, regardless of race, sex or standing in society. That is to say, capable of describing us as what we are deep inside: tramps in search of that golden chimera called happiness.

Rashomon is a very fine study of the genuine possibilities that humans have to access truth. Kurosawa does not exactly declare himself to be in favour of relativism. Rather, he encourages us to be wary of any rush to understanding, or treating as definitive the first versions of truth that we build. And everything is done with an enviable sense of the cinematographic, in a story where the actors’ performances acquire great relevance.

Violent yet profoundly human, The Godfather Part I works as a masterful portrait of modern societies. Coppola does not analyse his characters, nor seeks to moralise, but instead constructs these characters with all those ingredients that constitute the human condition. The visual and narrative elements are simply fascinating. 

The superbly thorough study that Fellini makes of a world characterised by the loss of moral values remains intact. But La Dolce Vita is not only about moral denunciation; it’s a film that has managed to leave for posterity sequences that work in the collective imaginary in an autonomous way.
 
Los Olvidados is a Buñuel film capable of higher strike rates than those by Italian Neorealism, and with the latter’s own ingredients. His look on the world of the poor is bereft of any kind of idealisation. The poor, by virtue of being ‘poor’, are not granted any assistance by history or reason. Buñuel gives voice to the excluded, but goes even further than fake compassion and shows the spiritual misery that hides behind all material poverty. 
 
In Ivan’s Childhood, his first feature, Tarkovsky seems to be complying with the demands of a cinema that praises the virtues of the ‘socialist man’, as was required at the time. However, his creative genius means he can insert sequences that go beyond any desire for a ‘socialist realism’, to show us a protagonist who is not only vulnerable because of his age and physique, but also because of his own nature. The childhood the title is referring to could also be interpreted as that fleeting, violent and innocent passage that is human life. 
 
In The Virgin Spring Bergman captures the innocence of an 18th-century Swedish legend in a film where the debate around Good and Evil reaches philosophic heights. But the profundity of the discussion is guaranteed by his masterful use of filmic language. With a perfect dramaturgic structure, the film manages to shift, with chilling effectiveness, from candour to anguish, leaving in the viewer that deep sense of unease that tragedy inspires.

Visconti’s extraordinary sensitivity manages to deliver a vigorous social portrait in the form of melodrama. The incredibly finely textured sociological study of the protagonist’s family members reveals a shocking emotional universe, and all the performances (all of them great) enable Rocco and his Brothers to acquire a great tragic density.
 
It Happened One Night is an unforgettable film. Capra unfurls his great gifts as a narrator, turning this simple (if only in appearance) romantic comedy into a memorable cinematographic exercise. The way in which he distributes the various tensions (sexual, economical, social) guarantees that the rhythm of the film is vertiginous at all times. 

Gutiérrez Alea’s Memories of Underdevelopment continues to be a surprising film which does not age, owing to the fact that, more than telling a story about a bourgeois man whose been surpassed by History, it examines the destiny of an individual who in reality feels like a foreigner in Existence. The fact that the plot is developed in the context of an underdeveloped country where a revolution is taking place can raise the suspicion that it is part of ‘the school of resentment’, but a closer look from our present perspective proves that its focus is not exactly sociological. Even people who live in first world countries can identify with this character’s scepticism, nonconformity and doubt in the face of that programmed optimism that elites seem to be dictating to us, dazzled as they are by the idea of the Progress of illuminism."

I think it also keeps winning because it’s about something – as long as there are Murdochs and post-Murdochs I expect it to go on winning.
Romantic comedies just don’t work, maybe because the third acts are cloying and clogged up with routine problem solving. Except for The Apartment, which is set in a tough world, not a hoped-for one, and has an ending it has truly earned. A loving follow-up to Vidor’s The Crowd – and even Wilder’s own great city symphony.
Moses supposes his toeses are roses. Through the faked-up DIY of Singin’ in the Rain, seemingly a mad throwing together of stuff that somehow just gels, we’re allowed to feel the joy of creativity and to glimpse the very human face of genius. It’s the least improvised film providing the most thrillingly spontaneous feeling to be had in a cinema.
Above all, the journey of roast duck across a dance floor in Modern Times defines what comedy is. It was always chock-full, delirious and madly overambitious – now each time it seems more beautifully un-American and so more provocative and important. HUAC were right to worry.
The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie was a flowering moment for Buñuel, offering a doorway to the mind of the Brecht/Picasso/Miles Davis of the movies – someone with the courage to challenge all of the rules all of the time. It’s a film that starts with a deliciously articulate title and delivers on it – showing how class, even at its very stupidest, colours even our most private imaginings – all without ever asking us to stop laughing.
Five Easy Pieces is a film that heralded everything that was indispensible in American independent film since the 1970s. It spans class and landscape, from late western wilderness to east coast high culture. Everything in the film speaks of alienation, compromise and repression – yet somehow it manages to continuously explode. 
As it ages, The Passenger reveals itself as a truly great modern work – an existential fable wrapped up in a romantic identity crisis built on what might be the beginning of a Hitchcock plot. The most expressive element in Antonioni’s work is the placing of characters in the landscape – this time with an unforgiving emotional clarity that some say is harder to find in his earlier films.
Effortless modernity retains its shock value in Breathless. You wonder what there was to discover after 1959. Most of all, it shows us what time just passing might feel like between humming, naming passing cars, rubbing our thumbs across our lips and making faces at the mirror – and immediately convinces us that it’s something the cinema was always supposed to describe.
Is North by Northwest parody or highlight? Here it stands in for a huge body of great work because it starts from the sleepy pleasure of being inside a movie, then at times gently reminds us how easily we might wake. The interior madness of it is always somehow held in check, as though we’re forcing our eyes to close again for more of the same, as it thunders along to an exquisite climax, rewarding our very simplest desires.
Latin storytelling – imbued with the eccentric spirit of the teller, our uncontrollable desire for the small details and the circuitous journey of discovery – was completely associated with epic family sagas in literature (and in degraded form, with Brazilian TV too) until Almodóvar taught us how to take it all in together on the screen. Like Godard and Leone, with films like All About My Mother, he stitched a new European cinema together out of the right found elements from all kinds of sources.

I’m embarrassed by the paucity of foreign-language films and the lack of diversity. It was a hard decision to include family entertainment over horror. I regret that there’s no comedy and not much dancing. I’m surprised that there’s nothing under the age of 30. But it’s only a movie list and – like life – we know that just because something is not on an official list doesn’t mean to say that it doesn’t count. Sometimes quite the opposite.
Suzy Gillett,73,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/73,programmer,UK,Female,critics poll,"International Relations manager, London Film School",10,"Jules et Jim is the film that always trips off my tongue when people ask me “What’s your favourite film?” I first saw it at the Scala in Paris; I actually had two friends who looked like Jules and Jim, and we’d wander about wistfully for days (they turned out to be gay and are still together some 25 years later). Jules et Jim is one of those films that seeps into your life and becomes a permanent fixture. I still have a record of Jeanne Moreau singing ‘Tourbillion’, which has to be one of the most beautiful musical moments in film.
I came across Pintillie’s oeuvre ridiculously late, and am still reeling from the shock of seeing The Oak last year in Cluj. In doing so I discovered a masterpiece and an explanation of the force behind the Romanian New Wave. The Oak grips you from the second it starts and holds you in its fist, with a tour de force performance by Maia Morgenstern.
3 Ali: fear eats the soul – rainer werner fassbinder – 1974 – Germany
Fassbinder was one of my favourite directors when I was in my early twenties. I watched his entire oeuvre in the arthouse cinemas of Paris, and Ali is one I have rewatched again and again. I had pictures on my walls of it; it struck so many chords – him, her, the impossible love, the scenes of them dancing, sitting in the rain in the cafe, the other cleaners on the stairs… I want to see it again now.
Rewatching L’Argent recently, I found it had more resonance than ever given the financial meltdown and the relationship money now has in our lives. It is in that early 1980s style that hasn’t yet become retro-fashionable, and gets entirely, oddly, awkwardly and defiantly straight to the point.
Djibril Diop Mambéty was way ahead of his time and died too soon. His classy stylish film Touki Bouki is unique in the canon of African cinema. Hip and dreamlike, this Dakarois Easy Rider set to the sound of Mbalax set off on what should have been a Senegalese new wave, but he tragically made too few films, and this seemed to promise things to come that never quite materialised.
Pinitillie’s second film Reconstruction has a phenomenal mise en scène, with epic long-shots that move across the landscape to follow characters that interact like cascading dominos, climaxing in a devestating finale. Utterly mesmerising.
I screened I Even Saw Some Happy Gypsies in Mosaiques 2005 from the BFI’s 16mm print – the geese, the feathers, the mud, the broken tv and singing in the bar and violent domestics. The film snapped several times and we sat in the dark on tenterhooks as it was taped back together – the audience whooped and cheered when it was over. Eat your heart out Kusturica.
Rosi shot Salvatore Guiliano in Sicily a decade after the events depicted there, so nearly everyone in the film is doing what they did and being who they were. It’s a kind of jigsaw neorealist reconstruction that dips in and out of the present and the past.
Sicilia! is the film of the book I reread the most, Elio Vittorini’s anti-fascist novel Conversations in Sicily. It’s an almost word-for-word adaptation of a story in which a man almost accidently takes the train from Milan to Sicily to see his mum, where he sits and eats sardines with her. Huillet and Straub reside on the far side of cinema, etching scenes like old masters in the Rennaissance, trying to perfect them. Their films can be hard work, but the effect of them lingers on permanently.
David Perlov is the unsung hero of documentary filmmaking, and The Diary is my desert island film, covering ten years of family life, various travels and friends’ visits. The editing is phenomenal – what appears simple is almost impossible to pull off when you try it at home. This is a film to be shown to all those budding filmmakers with their mobile phones. Put them away and do it properly."

I have made a list that contents more than 30 excellent films, which I consider to be the creme de la creme in the whole history of film. I am not able to cut it down. It’s why I have decided to name ten older films, which most influenced me in certain periods of my life.
Stalker is about searching for the truth inside us. Not one of its main protagonists is able to cross the border of the miraculous room: they are afraid of their real inner desires. It is also a film about victimising oneself for others; and about human modesty and humbleness.
The Seventh Seal is a great chess lecture on existentionalism played out in front of the cruelty of history and mankind.
The naked world of model situations and human relationships are presented in Marketa Lazarová: the innocent and weak ones die...
In Birds, Orphans and Fools we watch the irresponsible  and symbolic performance of a trio – two men and a woman – who willingly act like children in the aftermath of war. The tragedy comes with their adult steps.
In One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest we witness a great performance about human freedom. It’s made as a sort of mesalliance, where the Hollywood three-act structure is mixed with European storytelling. It’s appreciated on both sides of Atlantic.
For me Pierrot Le Fou was the first really postmodern movie. The colourful story (a couple on the run) is covered by pure cinematic invention and references to all kinds of arts and culture.
A great historical panorama about the change of epochs, The Leopard probes personal, historical and social issues. It’s noble storytelling, where beauty is everything.
Ana And the Wolves is a great analysis of a Spanish society ‘far from the madding crowd’. And a highly symbolic one.
A really manipulative and spiritual joke of a great director, who puts his message deep inside his story: the protagonist of Breaking the Waves, Bess, is saving her love by giving it to all around.
Blow Up is, simply, the existensial masterpiece of a great director."

They are all unpredictable, putting the camera where one is not supposed to, and this is the energy that will always renovate arts or cinema – having a critical look. The films are never simply a narrative or simply a story or simply aesthetics and form. They are a composition, and this is what makes them great."

Having to select only ten movies was harder than I imagined. However, aside from a somewhat melodramatic touch. I think the list does credit to the diversity that describes great filmmaking: the wonder of love, the terror of war, remembering what it’s like to be a child, learning what it means to become old, the coldness of loneliness or, how unfulfilled love can be meaningful. 
My list spans the grandiose and the intimate, the realistic and the allegorical. Some films are remembered for the imagery, others for their stories or their characters – all of them for teaching me about life. I learned to love the movies through Hollywood. This – and the fact that I am Scandinavian – has made my choices less international than I would have wished. (No Russians, no films from Asia.)

	As I enter my 59th winter, my list represents nothing more expert than a survey of some personal beacons. If I were invited to name my greatest filmmakers, the list might make my path look quite different (farewell Bob Fosse, hello Hou Hsiao-hsien.) These are ten of the films that left me feeling decidedly more experienced after our first encounter and have continued to excite me in substantially different ways on return visits. The Pajama Game (an ignominious 6.9 on imdb.com) is the only survivor from boyhood, when it was actually the much baggier Americana of The Music Man (7.6) that turned my little Kiwi head. The Altman – the least formally considered of my ten, but in its raggedness just as fully realised as any of them – was first met at 17. I loved it right off, but at the time it was The Last Picture Show that struck me as overwhelmingly adult and important. So it goes. It was never just about the movie."

Nashville is the most audacious American movie from the most adventurous period in American cinema and a great, prescient meditation on the decline of political discourse in the US. Passion is the greatest silent film ever made, one of the most stunning technical achievements in movie history – and Falconetti’s performance is probably the greatest like ever. Bringing Up Baby is the best screwball comedy and the best movie from the second greatest period in American cinema. Lacombe, Lucien is one of the bravest films ever made, and one of the most moral. Gillian Armstrong’s High Tide is probably the finest movie about parenthood and features Judy Davis in the second greatest performance in film history. Phantom of the Paradise presents capitalism as devil worship – how could I not include it? Videodrome, like Phantom, argues that paranoia is the only sane response to the current epoch, which is kind of an impossible position to disagree with. The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De La Cruz is the funniest dissection of faith ever made, from possibly the medium’s greatest artist. Calendar is, for me, the best, wittiest film by one of the world’s most intelligent filmmakers. Muhammad Ali: The Greatest is the best film about the politics of sports."

I have also excluded living artists from my selection – with the special exception of Manoel de Oliveira, who I’m adding as a coda for Aniki Bobó. Very different from the great films Oliveira has realised since the 1960s, this first feature, combining silent film techniques (despite the use of sound) – with very modern documentary realism, is an unpretentious masterpiece."

Akerman filmed Jeanne Dielmann, 23 quai de Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles at a lower camera height than one is used to – her own height (she is quite short) – and a feeling of claustrophobia seems to follow from that, pervading the film and, despite its dramatic ending, never fully abating."

Citizen Kane is the ultimate combination of multiple modes: high and low, bio, newspaper film, screwball tragi-comedy, satire and self-portrait of the octopus-armed artist as a young sacred monster. Children of Paradise is about the romance of romance itself, self-dramatisation through acting, poetry, love, death, nihilism and loss (that most romantic of all movie signifiers); the same can be said, in more modernistic terms, of Pierrot le Fou. The Last Bolshevik and Mirror are beautiful bookends of film as personal essay – fables about the inescapable persistence of the past. Blue Velvet and In a Lonely Place are tactile geographies of the male psyche and the women who remain beyond its grasp. Duck Soup and The Big Sleep, one anarchic and one as cool as Antarctica, are comedies of manners and moray eels, bullets and dames, civilisation and its discontents, as well as being peerless vehicles for those two exemplary Americans, Groucho Marx and Humphrey Bogart. And Ashes of Time can stand for the many varieties of Asian and art cinema, and even the Western it contemplates so gloriously from its vantage at the midway point from here to eternity."

All of them have hit me at a seminal moment and helped to suck me into a life in film that I have not been able to walk away from.
Gilda was one of so many late-night secret TV viewings as a teen, but was the one that introduced me to real star power from the second that Rita Hayworth flung her hair into the frame; Jeanne Dielman, first seen at college, shocked me with a new language and showed me the power of a form that could make me literally shout out just because someone hadn’t flicked a light switch; Todd Haynes’ entire output – even when it’s flawed – has somehow altered my very core, never more so than in Far From Heaven, with the audacity of dressing a group of characters as autumn leaves (with help from the brilliant Brit costumier Sandy Powell); films from Thomas Vinterberg, Woody Allen, the Coens and Wong Kar Wei have almost killed me with beauty, emotion, wit and an ability to take me out of myself and catapault me into a whole new world. My current job is focused entirely on British films – the three I’ve chosen here show the span of what we can do when we really want to: Ken Loach, never better than when ripping our heart out with that kid and that kestral; Nik Roeg making the link between the real and the surreal seem perfectly natural; and Clio Barnard, one of the greatest new voices of UK cinema, turning all our expectations on their heads and making me so excited about what might come next."

Some crowded into my memory by replaying the visceral response that the film first induced, such as the stomach-knotting intensity of The Hurt Locker or Apocalypse Now. Others, like An Angel at my Table, swept into my visual memory. Still more create snapshot memories that are expressions of the extraordinary tangle and diversity of humanity, like Water, Amarcord and even the bar scene from the original Star Wars film. Portrait of the artist movies are very often films that stay with me as extraordinary insights into extraordinary minds, as with writer Janet Frame in An Angel at my Table and David Helfgott in Shine. I also love the expansive feelings created by movies that are about music and musicians – hence Shine and the surprise (for me) choice of Mama Mia. And then there are those films that take you places you never thought you would go, like the incredibly transgressively Murmur of the Heart."

Pulp Fiction’s dialogue is as powerful as any of the guns, the killer soundtrack and the brilliant screen structure – this Tarantino masterpiece remains a cut above the rest. E.T. is a perfect blend of sci–fi and a touching family story, while capturing the backdrop of suburban Americana
“Round up the usual suspects,” goes the line in Casablanca. It was my first introduction to classic Hollywood and had Bogart at his best. The film and its dialogue are simply iconic. The Breakfast Club is the definition of teenage cinema, and John Hughes’ portrayal of 1980s angst resonated with a generation.
Nargess Rakhshan Bani-Etemad: At the height of Iranian cinema’s Renaissance, director Rakhshan Bani–Etemad raised the bar with Nargess and pushed the limits of the Iranian censorship code with this portrayal of Tehran’s outsiders. 
With its depiction of both the homeland and the diaspora, the Bollywood classic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge resonated with Asian audiences everywhere and took actor Shah Rukh Khan to megastardom.
Quick dialogue and great comedy, nobody writes female characters like Pedro Almodóvar, especially in Women On the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.
Film critic Roger Ebert aptly described Annie Hall as “just about everyone’s favorite Woody Allen movie”. Diane Keaton is perfection in style and performance, while Allen’s neurotic comedy is superb.

As much as I’ve been reverent and intrigued at times, I’ve been just as baffled or irritated by them. Making my list has been a fraught and anxious exercise; I confess that it has been emotional.
I’ve ended up with a personal list of ten films that I am frequently drawn to revisit. Each has changed the way I think about cinema and what it can achieve. All are directed by men, they come from just three different countries and two continents, and the most recent is more than 20 years old. I’ve not been able to acknowledge many of my heroes, which makes me less fretful in the cases of the always well-supported Welles, Hitchcock, Altman, Kubrick and Kurosowa than it does when it comes to, say, John Cassavetes, Hal Ashby, Wong Kar Wai, Charles Burnett, Alexander Mackendrick, Errol Morris, J. Lee Thompson, Ken Loach, Jafar Panahi, Tony Richardson, Nic Roeg, Mel Brooks or Laurel and Hardy. And a self-imposed rule of only including one film by each director has meant I’ve ditched films I cherish as much as I do Raging Bull, My Darling Clementine, The Godfather: Part II, Weekend and Hail Mary.
So, I’m sending my contribution with a furrowed brow and sweating palms. I wait to see the final list eagerly, as keen as ever to devour it, debate it and, in all likelihood, disagree with it. If the other contributors have endured anything like the angst that I have in putting their lists together, well, that is enough reason to think that the Sight & Sound poll should not be taken lightly."

Why, the one I am about to watch, at least until the projection starts.
Love of film makes optimists of us all.
But Sight & Sound requests a list of ten best movies, and optimism turns to anxiety. Shall I ‘me too’ with Citizen Kane, split hairs with
Godfather Part I and Part II or attempt to one-up with Warhol’s eight-hour Empire? But in truth, all cinema is personal, and so must be my list. Hence my ‘best ever’ list is a collection of significant films that have meant the most to me as both a critic and lover of film.
2001: A Space Odyssey because it never fails to show me something new, despite more than 40 viewings since 1968 The Tree of Life because it hints at realities outside the frame, past time and beyond the sky.
In the Mood for Love because it makes romantic longing so incredibly sexy.
Vertigo because it invites delirium with its suspenseful swooning.
Metropolis because it saw the dehumanised future long before it arrived. 
Tokyo Story because of the stillness and contemplation that approaches screen perfection. 
Playtime because it understands how modern life is both fun and frantic. 
La dolce vita because it knows that ‘the sweet life’ is more of the mind than the body. 
Apocalypse Now because it continues to mature as a statement of war’s futility. 
Sunrise because it unlocked the visual power of this new medium called film.

Doctor Zhivago vividly demonstrates how the whirlwind of political change affects an intellectual’s life and his family. Based on the Nobel Prize-winning novel, it won five Academy awards. Doctor Zhivago is an epic novel realised on screen through the combination of breathtaking images and a beautiful music score.
Grand Torino embodies the agony of multicultural American society. The change in the main character’s behaviour signifies what true hospitality towards immigrants and others means.

E.T.’s greatest appeal is that it views an alien through the unprejudiced eyes of children. The climactic scene in which E.T. and the kids fly through the night-sky on bicycles against the backdrop of a full moon is reaches a height of human imagination and will remain forever one of the most memorable scenes in film history.
By featuring a man who breaks into an empty house and starts to live there as if it is his own, 3-Iron relates the reality of modern people and families who are like empty houses. This movie tries to transcend our physical limitations, reaching the point where distinguishing fantasy from reality becomes meaningless.
In The Wood is based on an intelligent and skepticism-filled short story written by the modern Japanese writer Ryunosuke Ahkudagawa, about the murder of a samurai warrior at the hands of bandits. However, the testimonies of witnesses differ from each other. With its truly unique narrative style, this masterpiece reveals the selfishness of human beings.
Talk To Her movie can be described as a maximisation of the purity that Almodóvar pursues through his unique and exotic works of romance. Talk To Her tells us that social prejudice and ignorance towards the neglected classes can turn to violence, which again turns pure and earnest love into nothing.

I believe that all the films on my list are united by the personal vision of a filmmaker who went beyond the call of duty and against adversity to get them made; many on the list had notoriously troubled shoots or were vilified on release (although awards have also been showered on some). But all ten films have also affected me personally in my cinemagoing life and I can watch them again and again. On the downside, all these films are English language (mostly American), and the one German production was shot in the US. They also mostly originate in my teenage discovery years of watching 1970s cinema on VHS tapes or visiting the Scala or National Film Theatre for a weekly fix of Scorsese or Lynch, but this gives the list a personal touch. Of course, there are many great films made before 1965, and the last two decades has seen foreign-language cinema from across the whole world far outdo American cinema in terms of creativity and originality of vision. Women filmmakers too have been making great works throughout the 2000s. How has this selection affected my job as a film programmer mainly working with short films? It’s in shorts where filmmakers can take chances and be true to their visions; many are where filmmakers can cut their teeth with an outpouring of creativity, with no one to answer to. Such works can really get a new talent noticed. As a programmer of around 15 years, I’m always on the look out for such films, and have been blessed to see the early shorts work of Andrea Arnold, Lynne Ramsay and Andrew Kotting and watched their subsequent careers progress."

	Most of the films on this list were made under conditions of repression or during moments of profound change. Creativity and political tumult are somehow linked – this we see time and again. What intrigues me is the way that filmmakers turn to the melodramatic and the experimental at such moments. Experimental films are richest when they draw on the resources of melodrama, and melodramatic films are at their most radical when they have an experimental charge. Two films on this list don’t fit this description so well. One is here because it doesn’t seem to belong to any time – such is its creativity. The other is here because it teaches us that life is very disappointing."

Battle of Algiers stands alone as a piece of fictional documentary. I prefer Emile de Antiono’s 1968 documentary In The Year of the Pig (1968) over Peter Davis’ Hearts and Minds as the definitive piece of work on Vietnam (I think Davis used some of de Antiono’s footage). Filmmakers as diverse as Michael Moore and Errol Morris swear by The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On, about a Japanese Second World War veteran. Casablanca, Hitchcock’s The Birds, The Godfather and Raging Bull are all films my father – who loves cinema – introduced to me when I was a teenager. Finally, I picked two African films knowing full well they won’t probably make it far in the poll, but I feel strongly about their value as cinema. The first is Borom Sarret (The Wagoner), an 18-minute film set in newly independent Senegal by Ousmane Sembene, which is considered the first work directed by a black African, in 1966. Second, Mapantsula, a 1988 film about a gangster-activist made by the black-white South Africa duo of Thomas Mogotlane and Oliver Schmitz, which I consider to be the definitive film on Apartheid."

Alby James,833,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/833,programmer,UK/Africa,Male,critics poll,"Head of development, EON Screenwriters’ Workshop, Berlinale Talent Campus; head of Sediba Workshop, South Africa",10,"When one approaches a task like this, one assumes it will be easy to make a few deletions to the existing list to make room for special films of the last few years, but when it comes down to it, cutting even one film from the existing list is hard to do and, in the final analysis, those films one wants to add may not measure up to the standard of those one wants to cut. So one has to labour over these decisions, going back and forth to check whether the older films are still worthy of being the crowning glories of the history of cinema or whether tastes and perspectives have so changed that some films no longer have the same impact.
I have cut five films from the previous list of the top ten to make room for three films from the last decade and to add a film from each from the 1940s and 1960s that I think should be included. My criterion was fairly straightforward: to include films that are landmarks in the development of cinema, either for their technical brilliance or for their narrative content and bravado.
Like for most people, for me Citizen Kane still stands heads and shoulders above other films for its innovation and brilliance in storytelling and style. It’s a story about a big man, a man with many flaws, passions and ambitions. He’s an antihero, and Orson Welles and his co-writer, Herman J. Mankiewicz, make this dreadful man interesting by hanging the narrative on the investigation of the newspaper reporter, Thompson, who meets many people from Kane’s life to try and find out the meaning of Kane’s dying word, “Rosebud”. In addition to this narrative innovation, the film’s cinematography is also brilliant – and well documented. Citizen Kane deserves to remain in this list and will continue to be an inspiration to other filmmakers and audiences.
La régle du jeu by Jean Renoir is in my list because it too makes fantastic use of deep focus photography and camera movements, as if they were using a steadicam to fluidly change the focus from one group of people, and because Renoir gives us an insight into the frivolous behaviour of the aristocracy at a time when the country was descending into war. It’s well known that Robert Altman paid tribute to this film as being the one that showed him how to do movies like Gosford Park. Essentially, a French farce, La régle du jeu occurs mainly in a country house and the environs of its estate and the people in the film are those you would expect to populate it. What I like most about the storytelling approach is that Renoir fashions a multi-protagonist film successfully not by having a major plot that unifies them all but by making each of the characters, their relationships and the events that happen to them funny and engaging. I am a story development specialist and I know how hard it is to make this work.
The Bicycle Thieves is my next choice. I love it mostly for its simplicity. I wouldn’t be surprised if this were the film that most inspired Iranian writer/director Majid Majidi to make the wonderful Children of Heaven (1997). The premise is very straightforward: Antonio Ricci, a young married man who has been suffering a long period of unemployment, is offered a job as a bill poster – the only problem is that he has to have a bicycle to do the job. Since he has pawned his for a little money to survive, his wife decides to pawn their sheets to get his bicycle back. But when it is stolen on the first day, he’s in trouble. So the rest of the movie is about his search for his bicycle across Rome, accompanied by his small son, Bruno. It’s a touching story that engages the audience’s emotions and has them rooting for the protagonists all the time. And it is told in the neorealist style that makes it very affecting. Such a film will always remain a great example for new filmmakers without large funds. It proves that a simple premise and characters that we can care about are all you need to make a story work.
I have always loved my next choice, Breathless. I think it was the first film I watched when studying my A-level in French. This is a signature film that I have chosen to include instead of Fellini’s masterpieces, 8½ or La Dolce Vita, not because I don’t love those films (I do) but because I wanted to include two films that would speak to the youth of today, (the other film being Precious). Breathless is about posing, glamour and the excitement of committing crimes. Ultimately, it’s about anarchy, and the director, at the same time, is also putting two fingers up to filmmaking traditions. This is an exciting film with iconic lead characters, brilliantly played by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. This is the film that established the French New Wave as a defining movement.
A Separation by Asghar Farhadi is my next choice and it is there on merit, I believe, not just my taste. I nominated it for the Best Film and the Best Original Screenplay in the Baftas, not just as Best Film in a Foreign Language, because I truly believe it was last year’s best film. I have dissected the film many times and first came into contact with the project while sitting on the jury of the Berlinale’s World Cinema Fund. What we have here is another brilliantly told multi-protagonist, multi-plot story in which we care deeply not just about Nader and Simin, the husband and wife who we first meet before a judge. Simin is suing divorce so she can take their daughter out of the country for her sake, but her husband will not agree to let her take their daughter with her unless she asks him to let her go. The daughter loves both parents and wants them to stay together, so this is a ploy agreed with her father to keep her mother with them. Also in this family is Nader’s senile father, who needs full-time care, and Nader will not leave the country until his father dies. This leads to them hiring extra help, a carer, whose little daughter and unemployed husband also come into a story that has our emotions moving back and forth as it unfolds. Farhardi directs with a documentary style that gives it a great sense of being true. The performances are all brilliant and the feelings and thoughts stay with you long after viewing.
I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey on the big screen in Leicester Square as a member of a school party (we were studying the novel for English). I have seen the film many times since and have used it in my teaching. I have always been interested in human nature and what the future may hold for mankind, and this film acutely takes us back to the origins of mankind’s aggression, when we were apes fighting other groups of apes for access to the water hole and when a simple diet of vegetation was no longer satisfying. To see the transition of the ape into being a perpetrator of pain and death with the help of a large bone, and then this large bone being tossed into the sky and transmuting into a spaceship, said everything that needed to be said about man’s innate aggression and where it would lead. Kubrick’s adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s short story is a work of genius and will always be one. It was so far ahead of its time that filmmakers have to be even more ingenious now to do something fresh in the area of science fiction.
Play Time by Jacques Tati is the third French film on my list. I love all of Tati’s films and since I struggled with leaving both Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times and Buster Keaton’s The General off my list, it seemed to me that the best compromise was to select Tati’s own satire on modern life. One reason why I have appreciated the awards success of The Artist is because it reminds people that filmmaking is primarily about telling stories with moving pictures. The silent filmmakers were perfecting this technique when the talkies came in and I am delighted that artists such as Jacques Tati continued to work mainly in this form. But what I also love about his films is that he used them to uncover truths about human nature and society. My desire to see filmmakers have this purpose runs through all of my selections and, in Play Time especially, Tati was mainly interested in showing how people deal with technological developments. What Tati does in this film is expose how amazingly complicated modern innovations have become by having his regular character, Mr Hulot, follow a group of American women over 24 hours in Paris. I remembered this aspect of the film just the other day when buying a ticket from a machine in Nice for a train to Cannes. I had to go through an incredibly slow process to do this – it must have taken at least five minutes, as I had to go back to previous screens on three occasions. One of the things that cinema does well is show us the future. Sometimes, as we watch these films, we feel that we are already there. This is one of those films.
Vertigo is my next choice. There had to be one Hitchcock film in my list and I chose this over Psycho because it brings every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling together brilliantly to tell a very affecting story. Scottie falls obsessively in love with the image of a woman whom he cannot have. When he finds another woman who looks so much like her that a few changes can bring her back to him, he has to pursue this goal. When he finds out that the woman he loved was a construct herself, his grasp on reality is totally confused. Hitchcock takes this dilemma to its tragic climax.
The film plays constantly with truth and lies, or reality and dreams, using lighting, colours and camera positions to change the perspective. In the end, this is a story about the consequence of falling in love, which Hitchcock links with the fear of falling due to vertigo. Excellent!
Precious is in my list because in my opinion it is the first film about black people in the ghetto that was both honest and life affirming. The central character, Claireece Precious Jones (who calls herself Precious, for short) is an obese, illiterate 16-year-old girl who is also mother to a four-year-old Down’s Syndrome daughter and is now pregnant again, both times as a consequence of being raped by her father. Precious is also psychologically and physically abused by her mother. Just saying this would usually mean that the story had no potential in the commercial cinema, but Lee Daniels and his screenwriter, Geoffrey Fletcher, have worked together brilliantly to adapt the novel Push by the poet Sapphire, on which the film is based, to make it into a commercially viable film. Daniels, a former casting director, has also done superbly with the casting, finding newcomer Gabourey Sidibe to play Precious, comedienne Mo’Nique to play her worthless layabout of a mother and Paula Patton as her teacher at the alternative school where Precious enrols and who inspires her to believe in herself. Daniels even has Maria Carey as a tough-talking social worker and Lenny Kravitz as a sympathetic male nurse. Plus his treatment of the story – which is not unremittingly realistic, which would not work, but that uses heightened comedy at times and is artfully ugly at others – makes for a compelling melodrama. It pays off. The film connects with young audiences because it shows their world delivered in a palatable manner.
Finally, Battleship Potemkin. There is little need to say anything about this film. It is on my list because it is one of the first films to show the power of cinema and what it could achieve. Everyone talks about its use of montage, and is fantastically done. But it is also Brechtian in form, ie it is didactic. It wants to move viewers to feel differently and to act differently as a result of what they experience. As a result, it has been banned in many places. This film will always move people."

I dumped from my 2002 list three fabulous films that I love slightly less than I did perhaps because I’ve seen them too often: Barry Lyndon, The Conformist and Hotel Terminus. I did an auterist swap, I Know Where I’m Going! for Black Narcissus (pure favouritism), and I replaced L’Herbier’s L’Argent with The Passion of Joan of Arc simply because Falconetti got under my skin completely when I saw Dreyer’s film again recently.
Having seen how traditional so many of our voters have been, I feel more passionately than ever that the cinema of the last three decades is hugely undervalued. This is probably because consensus is harder to reach in an era when so much is available for us to watch. In that vein, most of the films it has pained me to leave out are relatively contemporary. Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman is one of the most psychologically subtle films ever made. Either Hidden or The White Ribbon from modern master Michael Haneke could or should have been there. I can’t believe I’ve left out Kiarostami’s magnificent Life and Nothing But, and Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó. And I’ve retained a deep affection and reverence for Michael Mann’s Heat. But my last nod is for a film that I immersed myself in preparation for talking about it last year at Finland’s Midnight Sun Film Festival: Carol Reed’s The Third Man. In so many ways it’s as corny as they come, but so rich in tragic irony it can still make you shiver. And yes, looking over it now it’s done, my list is obviously that of a hopeless romantic."

It forces the queried parties to not simply to identify the greatest films, but rather to promote an agenda regarding which films should be considered great and therefore what kind of films we should make, watch and promote within our cultures. As the dean of the Czech film school, I feel obliged to promote two agendas: 1) advocating Czech films, since cinema has been essential part of Czech culture for over the last century; 2) recognising the masters who have created the horizon that provokes and inspires our students. I have asked some of my colleagues for help, but even with their assistance, finalising a list of ten has been a cruel exercise of exclusion. With great omissions (and with a preoccupation with the past), here is a list of films that should be recognised for their greatness."

Its purpose is not to establish a catalogue of masterpieces or a collection to watch on a desert island, but just what I think represents the evolution of film as an artistic expression in the last century. To explain why I chose these ten titles and left out others that I also love would demand much more space that is reasonable in this collective poll.

When I look over the ten films listed alphabetically, I only cover a period of four decades. I had hoped to have reached further and broader, but this list will always be incomplete. I cannot cover all bases. It is inescapable that these are my inclinations and have nothing to do with film history. If there will ever be another list, will I be more discriminating? This process of listing is a dangerous one, causing one to weigh up passion versus necessity. Almost anything can be argued for, but what is real is how generous a companion the cinema has been to me. I am amazed at all I have seen, and yearn to be shown so much more.

“Brancusi said that creation should be as easy as breathing; and his beautiful and perfect works attest to the depth and ease of his breath. But sometimes the breath comes hard, in choking spasms, and sometimes it is reduced to the merest sibilance. Creation is just as uneasy as breathing. With inspiration, we draw in breath. In the end, we expire. While the breath runs, we feel moved, mysteriously, to conspire, to share breath. Of all the arts, none responds more fully and intricately to the flow of the breath of life than does film, nor does any other give itself so freely to the sharing of breath, unless we take inspiration from Ovid and look to an Art of Love, in which closest of all conspiracies we conceive, and were conceived.”

So, why choose the ‘official’ chronologically ordered ten? It’s certainly not because of any certitude in the matter of ranking.

I saw the full version of Seven Samurai in the late 1970s and since then it has become my favorite Japanese film ever. After the opening-up of China in the early 1980s, we rediscovered Chinese classics of the 1930s and 1940s, of which Spring in a Small Town and The Road are the most memorable.

As it happens, the four films on the list which might conceivably be seen as ‘consensus’ picks —Citizen Kane, Psycho, Singin’ in the Rain, The Searchers — are also ones close to my heart, or at least the formation of my sensibility. The other six came to me after a lot of internal debate over whether I was being different for the sake of being different or whether these were not in fact truly great films that, when the time comes for these sorts of surveys, do not get the proper recognition for being the imaginatively prodigious, paradigm-shifting, galvanic works that I believe they in fact are.
Of course I regret that my list cannot be longer, because surely Sansho Dayu, The General (not to mention Sherlock Jr.), The Last Temptation of Christ and a lot more ought to have a place, and the more I think about the films and filmmakers I am leaving off (Yang! Naruse! And, yep, Godard; what am I thinking?) the more I can twist a long knife inside my guts and brain. Despite all that, this is a list that satisfies me.

But, anyway, for me there are two ways of choosing: first, by the head – to count the movies that have a place in the history of world cinema or that led a new wave revolution; second, by the heart – movies that impressed me emotionally or were revolutionary to my consciousness. 
This list includes more films that I saw for first time when I was young, at a time when I didn’t recognise cinema as an art. This includes films such as Atalanta by Griffith, which I am sure must be included in a top ten of world cinema. For me, it holds a historical place in the world cinema, as with the films of Jean Vigo or Abel Gans.
This is how I explain the fact that I did not include the films from this early epoch, except for Sergey Eisenstein’s Battleship Potyomkin, from 1925. On the other hand, the latest year I have included is 1969, when Visconti made his Gotterdammerung. There is no movie from the last 43 years! Perhaps more recent films could be considered rather for a top 100 than for the top ten."

The other is a group of Soviet Bloc films that use a variety of means to tell us how things worked or didn’t work there. Klimov manages to straddle both groups.

If this list serves as a superficial indicator, my favorite films are staged narratives (six titles), American (five) and on average 80 minutes in length. How oddly, appallingly conventional! An eviscerator of personal taste, the statistics machine brings up the question of whether canons in cinema can mean anything today with so many films existing and so much/many history(ies) to choose from. My idea was to make a list and to narrow it by applying a rationale to each film. Thus, major studios (Biograph, Shochiku, Paramount) had to be complimented by institutions that, over the second half of the 20th century, proved equally monolithic: Castro’s Cuba, Warhol’s Factory. The zenith work of New Taiwanese Cinema, a national movement that provided a model for the success and failure of world cinema culture as we came to know it in the following decade and a half, is bookended by a lyrical American silent made by a director who didn’t only provide the model, but everything that we know about… oh, who am I kidding? The only way to submit to this impossible task was to keep things strictly personal, and the reasons for including these films (and the bonus video) are, in the end, no one’s business but my own."

Battleship Potemkin put theoretical notions about polemical filmmaking into dynamic action. 2001: A Space Odyssey was my gateway drug to the avant garde. The Searchers imbued the American frontier with poetic depth, illustrating the rendering mythology as lyricism that transcends its moral ambiguities. Psycho takes the Hitchcock slot just like City Lights takes the Chaplin one, because every great Hitchcock movie testifies to his masterful blending of entertainment and psychological depth. Chronicle of a Summer is simply the finest illustration of a national mindset captured in moving-image form. Taxi Driver demonstrates how movies not only think but can have an attitude.

To focus and make the selection easier I have set a number of rules. Three films represent the silent era from approximately 1888 to 1928; an additional three black-and-white films represent the time before all-pervasive colour. There is no more than one film per country and each continent is represented. 
Like many great directors Von Stroheim’s output was small (seven features) but his influence profound. Stroheim’s loose adaptation of The Merry Widow takes half its very long running length to reach the point at which Lehar’s opera begins. Paradoxically made with both an obsessive attention to detail and realism, Stroheim pushes the emotions to the hysterical and sexual brink. Its huge commercial success after the travesties of Merry Go Round (1922) and Greed (1923-4) sent Von Stroheim into a bout of depression but allowed him to continue production of his artistic follies, at least for two further films. Although hounded by US moral guardians and Hollywood (who didn’t know what to do with this eccentric genius) Stroheim’s work stands as an ultimate tribute to Hollywood’s resilience.
Faust was the apotheosis of Eric Pommer the Ufa Studio’s overreaching ambition to create an international market for German cinema. The film is a breath taking tour de force of special effects and technical innovation that is subjugated to the human drama at its heart. A pinnacle of bravura filmmaking that is not as iconic as Goethe’s classic, but it is nonetheless a cinematic masterpiece worthy of its filmmaker’s abilities.
La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc comes from the time when silence was the international film language and film could also be culturally very specific. Based on the trial transcript, the film ostensibly portrays the psychological torture of a young woman – Model Falconetti’s distress is palpably real and her pained expression is indelibly etched into Dreyer’s film. Dreyer’s austerity and rigour are astounding and, amazingly, this film was patched together from outtakes after the original negative was incinerated in a factory fire.
With its Chaucer’s Prologue, where a falcon morphs into a Spitefire, followed by the first scene introducing the main characters, shot in near darkness during a wartime blackout, A Canterbury Tale demands your attention. This eccentric and mystical film is a choice set of vignettes glued together by a barebones narrative, where wish fulfilment in Canterbury is the aim. A near-religious experience, that allows one to understand, better than almost any other wartime propaganda film, why British cultural values are worth the sacrifice.
Scandinavian filmmakers have made an underappreciated contribution to the development of cinema. Their cinema is physically and emotionally pervaded by the harsh realities of climate. In The Seventh Seal, a dissertation on existentialism and religion, a ubiquitous and fateful mood of death and despair hangs heavy. The image of the knight playing chess with Death, in order to prolong his quest for answers, is unforgetable. Although Bergman’s critical cache may have waned, enthusiastic audiences still connect with the existential and striking artistic values of one of the bastions of ‘serious, foreign-language’ cinema.
The Battle of Algiers is a seminal political film of the 1960s and 1970s, and banned in France as well! Although directed by an Italian director, the film was made in collaboration with the Algerian government and presents an African perspecive on events, marking it an important work in the naissance of African cinema. Its neutral perspective and documentary-style vérité cinematography allegedly made it a manual for armed insurrection, as well as a guide for counter-insurgency. Morricone’s driving score combine with the film’s sly visual style and Pontecorvo’s passion for the cause to produce a lasting impression.
The complex, elegant, and labyrinthine A Touch of Zen marks the maturation of WuXia and has remained its template to this day. Hu’s fastidious attention to detail, combined with the dynamic editing and precise choreography of the fighting scenes, creates an exhilarating feast for the senses unmatched in mainstream action cinema, which is immeasureably indebted to this and the other martial arts films of Hu.
From small beginnings with the original Mad Max, Mad Max 2 expands and alters the original’s concepts, and with a larger budget takes on Hollywood with a vengeance. Influenced by and modernising the iconography of the Western (and Corman’s car crash movies) this film’s appropriation of the punk aesthetic, a post-apocalyptic vision and no-nonsense, adrenaline-fueled action revitalised the action genre for a several decades.
In oppressive regimes artists often resort to allergory, but not in The Circle. Daringly, Panahi goes straight for the jugular. In this heavily atmospheric film, men are the envied other, only sighted in the distance or at the edges of the frame, enjoying the privileges of male society. It is a ‘horror’ film in which Teheran women are subjected to dark and mysterious forces that snatch their bodies and souls, leaving them in a state of constant fear, and at its conclusion, the circle is completed and depressingly, we are back where we started. This is a very original film from a very original filmmaker.
Essay films have an enviable tradition and Nostalgia for the Light’s patchwork of seemly disparate elements, from the infinity of the cosmos to the search for human remains in the Atacama Desert, seamlessly links the strands with a quiet rage and cinematic sophistication far exceeding most filmmakers’ aspirations."

So I tried to loosen up, but still regret that I had to leave out La règle du jeu, Metropolis, Belle de Jour, L’Atalante and Turkish contemporaries such as Times and Winds, Clouds of May, Innocence, Somersault in a Coffin or cult clasic Time to Love, and countless more.

Film Studies, Queen Mary University of London",10,"Choosing ten great films (as opposed to the ten greatest films) does take away a tiny bit of the pressure, and this is what I have done. I resisted the temptation to look at previous top ten lists first, though I did have a reasonable recollection of the kinds of titles that feature on them: a tendency towards auteur films; a prominence of Euro/North American work, of fiction films, feature-length films, ‘serious’ subjects and ‘poetic’ treatments; and of course the enduring prominence of Citizen Kane. I don’t think my list departs greatly from this overall trend, though it does include a couple of examples of types of film that rarely feature. And there are obvious omissions: no musicals or comedies, for example; only one film by a female director; none from parts of the world (India and Latin America, particularly) with longstanding traditions of filmmaking; and from those key decades for experimental filmmaking and popular cinemagoing, the 1930s and 1940s, just one documentary short.
Several of my chosen titles are ones that sprang to mind right away. Others, after some thought and sifting, emerged as key exemplars in critical categories like national cinema, genre, period or auteur. I avoided including personal favourites solely because I love them (ie there had to be other reasons for inclusion), and have not ruled out any film merely because I dislike it. Since, it seems to me, the jury is still out on more recent work, my final list of ten is — a little conservatively, perhaps – confined to films made before 1980. It’s too soon to tell, of course, but a listing of the greatest films made since that date would likely, given the increased visibility of world cinema, feature a greater proportion of non-western titles. My own (provisional) choice might include, say: Yellow Earth (China, 1984), Distant Voices, Still Lives (UK, 1988), Beau Travail (France, 1998), Caché/Hidden (France, 2005), Syndromes and a Century (Thailand, 2006), and A Separation (Iran, 2011).
There are a number of directors whose body of work, taken as a whole, surely qualifies them as being among cinema’s greatest auteurs (Hitchcock, Eisenstein, Ray, Bergman and Bresson, for example), but for whom I’d feel hard pressed to pick out individual films to put on the list. Many think that Hitchcock’s Vertigo is his best, but forced to choose, I would probably go for Rear Window. Ray’s best, in my view, is possibly Charulata, though Pather Panchali has a strong claim. Bergman’s oeuvre is so extensive that it is near impossible to fix on one film – I would (hesitantly) put forward Fanny and Alexander. For different reasons, Eisenstein is equally tricky: Ivan the Terrible, perhaps? Bresson’s films convey a distinctive and inspiring cinematic vision, but again it seems impossible to choose any one title over others. Ozu, I would maintain, transcends authorship: like many westerners, I discovered his work through the subtle and intensely moving Tokyo Story, only much later getting to know his other films (Late Spring particularly impresses). In fact, Tokyo Story was one of my immediate choices.
The 1920s surely produced some of the very greatest films ever, with the late silent cinemas of Scandinavia and Germany excelling. Metropolis, for example, could qualify on the grounds of its influence on subsequent world cinema. But, as cinema, a worthier inclusion, I believe, is The Last Laugh, and accordingly this film appears on my list.
As with directors, so with significant film movements: among the European ones, my vote goes with the Nouvelle Vague, and with Les quatre cents coups as its greatest representative. Outside Europe, New Hollywood must figure as well, represented by either The Conversation or Raging Bull, I think, with the former nosing slightly ahead.
If only to make a claim for the potential greatness of fiction films that aim for lightness and entertainment, I intended to include a comedy or a musical among my ten. However, the final cut came down to a tough choice between the incomparable Some Like It Hot and Jeanne Dielman, an altogether different sort of film, but an essential inclusion for its aesthetically and politically groundbreaking qualities. The only Hollywood genre film in my final ten (and another of those on my immediate list) is The Searchers, a Western that, for all its flaws, exemplifies, embraces and above all transcends its genre, a rare piece of cinema that arguably merits a place in the wider pantheon of American art.
Documentary and experimental films are often overlooked in greatest films polls, and I want to put in a strong claim on behalf of a bold, exciting and dazzling piece of experiment that embodies both: Man with a Movie Camera, another of my immediate choices. The poetic documentary Listen to Britain is one of two personal favourites that I include among my ten greatest; the other being the ever-astonishing avant-garde piece Wavelength (preferably on 16mm).
And last, The Leopard is included because it is a towering, magnificent, wonderful aesthetic and political achievement"

It’s more a record of past experience and current feelings rather than an objective attempt to stratify history. If you tell me that one of these films is playing, chances are I’ll be there. Without a doubt I will emphatically insist that you must go. A few of my picks are shorts, and one title (NYC Street Scenes) is raw footage from a newsreel. Feature length is in large part a ruse: a film is over when it is finished, whether counted in seconds or hours. The classics endure (Touch of Evil being far better than Citizen Kane) and will out rule my selections, which is OK. I don’t necessarily suggest that my choices are better, but for me, writing today, they are the best."

Unnecessary to repeat how difficult it is to chose only ten films and how impossible it is to compare some of these extremely different films. I might say that it was important for me to include some new and recent films, because these lists tend naturally towards the old films, the classical ones, while for me cinema should not be classical but in constant movement, always doubting its own values and neglecting its own hierarchies. However, even this one criteria of selection didn’t demand any real efforts. The recent films I've selected were, to my eyes, so charismatic and so convincing."

In general it is director-centred, and it has involved near-impossible choices, forced by the limit of ten. If the list could be longer it would take in work by, for example, Grigori Kozintsev, Andrei Tarkovsky, Roberto Rossellini, Akira Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray, R.W. Fassbinder, Pedro Almodóvar, Wong Kar-wai, Chen Kaige, Raoul Ruiz and Patricio Guzman. Perhaps in 2022, you might allow your critics a list of (say) 30?
If there is any principle linking the titles, it is that each of them exercises the widest-ranging attention to complexity of story, character, politics and ethics, and each attains its ends through an orchestration of sound and image, narrative, performance, and argument either explicit or implied. The choices also seek to extend the conventional range, choosing Le Crime de M. Lange from Renoir’s work instead of La règle du jeu, Rear Window from Hitchcock’s rather than Vertigo, The Last Bolshevik from Marker rather than Sans Soleil, Liberty Valance from Ford rather than The Searchers. There is no way, in any of those cases, that I could argue that the films chosen are superior to those I have omitted.
My greatest regrets relate to film essays and documentary. Reluctantly, I left out Resnais’ Nuit et Brouillard in favour of longer (not larger) works; there was no room for Humphrey Jennings’ Fires Were Started, none for Guzman’s Nostalgia for the Light. I suggest that after the work of Chris Marker, the distinction between feature and documentary is simply out of date, while the category of the film essay has gained increasing critical prominence."

They drift with the clouds. The top three, however, has been unchanged for years. And of these three, I could even narrow it down to particular ‘great’ scenes: in the first, the famous singing and dancing in the rain; in the second, the opening sequence with the English voiceover, but with the original French Racine quote: “The distance between countries compensates somewhat for the excessive closeness of time” (although I love the Eliot one too); in the third, the final pandemonium that spells/says/sings: ‘All You Need is Love’. These scenes made me love cinema. In all, it’s about the magic, discomfort and capacity to see beyond the image.
The other films all blew my mind at some point, probably for the same reasons. But I cannot exactly say why – that is why I keep returning to them. In general that is my only criteria in compiling lists and ‘rating’ films: which ones would I like to see again, here and now. It happens rather intuitively. But I have to bow my head in humility for not being able to include John Smith’s The Girl Chewing Gum, Abbas Kiarostami’s The Wind Will Carry Us, Tsai Ming-liangs What Time is it There? and Abderrahmane Sisako’s Bamako or Agnès Varda’s Les plages d’Agnès.

Just this morning I was amused by a reader’s punctuation-challenged comment after a film review: “If critics cant give objective reviews what is the point?”
I imagine anyone who presumes subjectivity has no place in film criticism would feel more entitled to name The Ten Greatest Films Of All Time than I do. All I can offer is ten films that, on first acquaintance, showed me something in the medium I hadn’t seen before – and that continue to surprise and excite upon multiple revisits.
Whittling the list down to its present form was troubling enough; ranking them any further proved impossible. I’ve long said that Gone With the Wind, an unmatched feat of sustained storytelling, is my favourite film, though it probably has the least claim to singularly astonishing filmmaking of any title on this list. How could one rank it above or below the immaculate likes of Persona and Vertigo, an oddly ideal double-bill I arrived at only after agonising consideration of both directors’ filmographies? How can one compare the jangly candour of Truffaut’s child’s-eye view with the hushed spirituality of Erice’s? And how can one pit either of these finely tuned, eternally expanding miniatures against the novelistic bustle of Allen’s finest hour, or the gasping sensual explosion of Powell and Pressburger at their most romantic? Is it too soon to include White Material, a film whose tingly, tactile construction stunned me as much as its politics reached unnervingly into my own African childhood? Possibly, but after a handful of canon titles reached stalemate for the final spot, I reached for Claire Denis’ film as an investment pick of sorts: if I had no belief in contemporary cinema’s ability to produce films to last, I’d find another line of work."

Definitely the strongest debut of all the time.
There isn’t nothing bigger and better than Battleship Potemkin when it comes to editing. The whole basic theory of editing is contained within this film. Potemkin is the beginning of the beginners. 
Andrei Rublev is a strongest story about the artist – the suffering of the creator and creation. Tarkovski made the individual story of Rubljov much bigger then it was in reality until finally it is like a symbol, an archetype of the artist and his relationships with power and absolutist authority. I also like the visual language of the film. The scene with bells is one of the greatest in history of the cinema.
Zero de Conduite displays an amazing sensuousness of image. Amarcord is a hearty, dreamlike insight in flashback. Pulp Fiction is built from fantastic combinations of Godar and Hawks, and symbols of satirical violence. In The Taste of Cherry, Kirostami proves himself to be the master of the philosophy of the simple life, and I am bonded to his masterly humanism and bewitched by his visual world. Yi Yi is a sensitive movie, very beautifully shot, well acted, human and emotional, and with balanced humour. But sadness is absorbing...
It’s useless to try to say something with two words about Four Seasons…  but if so, it must be about it’s concentration of philosophy and poetry.
Finally, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, which had a big personal impact on me when it came out. The film has a strong message to everyone who, after the events in Prague in 1968, should have to stayed on the other side of Iron Curtain. Well directed and well acted. Jack Nicholson is great!"

Breathless has an excellent mise en scène and explores how narration merges with meta-film reflections.
The Innocent shows the power of elegent indulence as aesthetics of cinema. 
Blow-Up is another reflection on reality and the intolerance of art, and is so rich in visual layers.
Federico Fellini, La Dolce Vita suceeded in bringing out the notion of the dialectic bittersweet relationship. It’s also a strong criticism of capitalist city lives.
Ashes of Time is a deep and double-edged discourse on love, refined with classic dialogue.
Aguirre, Wrath of God reminds us the absurdity of life and the arrogance of human beings – the images of vanity; the sighs of actuality.

There should be no numbers in such rarified air, but I have organised the titles into an approximate if slippery order of preference. I find the complete omission of silent and animated films tragic, but as I’ve often thought, it’s people’s top 11-20 choices that often yield the most interesting pictures. That said, I believe I’ve succeeded in squeezing more interesting titles closer to the top than in previous years.
I was very late in catching up with this L’Eclisse, but the decades-long delay did nothing to make its comments on relationships in a post-war, suburban and artificial landscape any the less pertinent. This is the only film I know that understands exactly how much to withhold – of its characters and its story – to make its overall construct ring true. Its uninhabited, cubist finale is the greatest of all time. 
Les enfants du paradis is the only film I know that has all the nutrition of a great novel, the kind you can’t bear to end; its abrupt ending, which washes the world it has constructed away, leaves one in complete awe of its powers of invention.
I first saw Once Upon a Time in the West film at the age of 12; I went to see the Elvis Presley movie Charro! that was playing with it. I wasn’t a fan of the genre, so I didn’t recognise that Leone’s film was a pastiche of dozens of other Westerns, but I feel I lost something of my virginity to it, and when I staggered out of the theater without seeing Charro! because I knew it couldn’t possibly compare to what I’d just seen, I made what I now recognise as my first adult decision.
I would prefer to list the whole Three Colours Trilogy as a whole, but limited to one, I find Three Colours: Red more certain of itself, less enigmatic, and thus more moving than The Double Life of Veronique. Not only is it the greatest platonic love story I’ve seen, it acknowledges a side of life I’ve always known and, before this film, felt alone in knowing.
The most passionate and articulate of political films, The Devils is intellectual and feverish, absolutely inspired in its design, appropriately terrifying, and yes, outrageous – because it is outraged. This may be the cinema’s most damning indictment of humankind, and it is refreshed every time someone fails to see beyond the shame it depicts to its spine of dignity. 
Having lived in different people’s homes as a youngster, and having been subjected to their whims, cruelties and almost random kindnesses, I often sought refuge in the unconditional love of animals, all of which makes Au Hasard Balthazar the most compassionate of films and the unusually cathartic for me.
There is almost too much magnificence in Bergman to consider, and there are titles I know better and perhaps love harder, but Fanny and Alexander film gives us his most generous assembly of unforgettable characters, and its aspects of magic and melodrama now find it knocking Cocteau’s Beauty and the Beast off my list as the greater fairytale.
Wry, patient, beautifully and meticulously observed, Barry Lyndon is the screen’s most convincing and picturesque evocation of an earlier time, and the slyness of its expression opens a whole new wing of subtlety. Beyond all that, it nails the human race. 
Much as in the case of my choosing Fanny and Alexander over Beauty and the Beast, Andrzej Zulawski’s The Most Important Thing: Love has done the once unthinkable by bumping Godard’s Contempt off my top ten. Both films are about the movies, the pinch of business against the purer yearnings of the spirit, and what is unknowable in the dynamics between people, and they also share a similar Georges Delerue score, but what I find most captivating – despite Romy Schneider’s heartrending performance and Jacques Dutronc’s jokerly tragedian – is its depiction of courtly love in a harsh and brutal world.
Man on Wire, James Marsh’s documentary about Philippe Petit’s 1974 tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, is a breathtaking testament to the achievements that are within reach of the daydreaming mind every day. Now that the towers themselves no longer exist, the film’s importance quantifies as Petit’s glorious (because of its essentially meaninglessness) feat assumes a greater surrealistic, colossally abstract dimension, as we ponder what survives today of his death-defying lark."

As this is a list of movies, and not of authors, I often chose, to the detriment of my favourite authors, movies which were the result of, in a more organic and spontaneous way, the dynamics between the societies which produced them and their reflection, the cinema; movies which embodied a certain zeitgeist. I assumed, in a somewhat Godardian way, that the history of cinema is the history which projects itself, which means that I tried to think of movies not only in terms of the history of cinema (the history of aesthetics and of cinematographic styles), but above all in relation to the history of the 20th century– which is also not entirely true, given the absence of the Soviet classics in the list. The movies chosen are nonetheless all auteur movies, but in them the role of the auteur is much less important than the collective strength and vigour which circumscribed the creation of the work, acclaiming it first and foremost as a sort of collective announcement. In these, the auteur comes in, first and foremost, as a mediator and a trigger of a collective process which invariably involves competent and faithful collaborators, real teams in the prime of productivity. Many of these movies are, therefore, the result of years of partnership between moviemakers and their respective crews and acting troupes – if it is a fact that every production worth of respect must be a secret plot among those who take part in it, the movies in this list may actually be seen as very well-orchestrated plots."

If you asked me in a year’s time, I imagine that the list might be quite different. Although maybe not…
Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey changed everything I thought I knew about cinema, while Terrence Malick’s transformation of pure human feeling into light and sound in Tree of Life did it again. These two films, together with Lars Von Trier’s Melancholia, form an incredible triad of slow and painful epic beauty that, for me, function as a single transcendent work. Walt Disney’s Pinocchio was the last film to truly terrify me, while Brokeback Mountain provides one of the most honest accounts of human relationships in cinema, as well as having the best kiss. Children of Heaven is easy proof that you can tell a deeply sentimental story without resorting to sentimentality, and Djibril Diop Mambéty’s Hyenas made me reconsider the limits of film. I love Fargo for Frances McDormand and the woodchipper. As for Wings of Desire, if angels see in black and white and humans see in colour, Wim Wenders sees in another spectrum of light altogether. Finally, The Wizard of Oz was pure magic when I was a child and it remains astonishingly good as an adult viewer.

",10,"Citizen Kane was my top choice in Sight & Sound 40 years ago. It still is – emphatically. I could pick ten Hitchcock films as the entire best ten – Vertigo makes it here. Eloquent silent comedy like The Gold Rush must endure. Buster prevails in The General. Jules et Jim is unique and provocative, and the letter sequences still resonate today – ‘snail mail’ letters may be archaic in the land of tweets, but miscommunication still is universal and rampant. La Dolce Vita brings together Fellini (a great humanist and social critic), Mastroianni and alienation. Humanity – and its loss. Classic.
Stanley Kubrick and I had a thing going. He was very generous to me about my reviews of his films. I have chosen 2001: A Space Odyssey here. Chinatown is potent, personal cinema and clever, meaningful dualities. I find it the most rewarding film to teach.
My last two choices could be any of 20 films. Come back, Shane. I searched (pun intended) and remembered Shane. Although I realise purists might frown, I love the myth in Shane. It takes me back to my boyhood, when Alan Ladd (just ahead of Huntz Hall) was my favorite actor. Films and youth forever.
The Insider is Mann’s paean to integrity. It has a terrific cast – Pacino, Crowe, Plummer et al – and canny direction. I relate to Lowell at the end when he walks out of the door – leaving behind his old world of rules and capitulation.

If they are all very old (the most recent is 54 years old) it is because I have chosen only fool-proof movies that I have watched many times and in the course of at least 50 years, excluding both those which I have seen only a couple of times or only quite recently.

In hugely contrasting ways, The Godfather and Tokyo Story are without peer in the way that they speak of family and society; Vertigo and Raging Bull in their exposure of our darkest selves. I also wanted to acknowledge the contribution of actors, hence my choice of The Godfather over its sequel, and of His Girl Friday, because of the presence respectively of Brando and Grant, the two greatest performers in the medium.

Citizen Kane is nearly perfect as either ‘art’ or showbusiness.

Godard is bolder (and maybe closer to my politics) but I prefer Truffaut. The 400 Blows stands for the breakthroughs of the French New Wave and all new waves past and future.
From the golden age of silent comedy, The General is as funny as it gets, with ingenious storytelling and filmmaking.
Metropolis is a pinnacle of Ufa, Fritz Lang and the silent era.
Nashville is a one-of-a-kind, crazy-quilt microcosm of America.
La règle du jeu is the Renoir of Renoirs.
Seven Samurai is consummate Kurosawa and perhaps the greatest action picture ever made, as emotionally as it is physically exhausting.
Bergman insisted on exploring profound ideas in film. Doomsday parable The Seventh Seal, at only 96 minutes long, is packed with questions about the meaning of life and death and the existence of God. yet it is also grand entertainment.
My ‘greatest’ films – quickly narrowed down to narrative features – combine three criteria: first, the chosen film is generally one of the best in a great filmmaker’s long career; the film also had to be a landmark or influential – I might adore La Strada or Day for Night, but 8 ½ and The 400 Blows are the greater milestones, and while other Altman titles may draw votes, Nashville is his legacy film; finally, I chose the ten that I would pick to take to a desert island.

Yet the pace never flags, and it is staged, shot and acted flawlessly.
Umberto D is a simple, humble film about a crotchety man and his dog, but it’s emotionally devastating. Social realist filmmaking at its best.
You need a good comedy in your life, and it doesn’t get much better than gender-bending romp Some Like it Hot, with its music and Shakespearian mistaken identities.
Sweet Smell of Success gives us New York in all its crummy glory, with fantastic performances, glorious dialogue and morally ambiguous characters. “I love this dirty town.”
Three Women is Altman’s most under-appreciated film. It’s a dreamy, challenging work about the fluidity of personality, in which he manages to out-Bergman Bergman.
Apocalypse Now is a compelling, groundbreaking film about the journey into the heart of darkness and the insanity of war.
Ran is an incredible transposing of the heartbreaking King Lear to feudal Japan: huge emotions, incredible acting, tremendous characters and staging, all shot by a master.
Miller’s Crossing remains my favourite Coen Brothers film, a quintessential gangster movie with a flawed, dubious hero at its centre.
Three Colours: Blue is Kieslowski’s touching portrayal of the journey through grief and mourning to forgiveness and new life. It’s incredibly shot and layered with harmonious music and colour.
In The Straight Story a man travels to reunite with his brother, yet the journey is the important part. It is slowly, sensitively and sympathetically shot, with a griping central performance.

Some two decades ago, I opted for eclecticism for this poll, selecting strictly personal and sentimental favourites, which in retrospect strikes me as a classic case of self-indulgence. What is to be made of the 1960 epic, Mughal-e-Azam, a fable about a courtesan and her doom-laden love for an emperor’s son? It’s undoubtedly a great film but was still a strictly subjective choice. This time around I’ve attempted to see the larger international picture, albeit not without lapsing into an entirely emotional final pick, Imitation of Life. It is proudly melodramatic and has not aged with time (confession: still has me howling into a handkerchief while the modern The Help doesn’t).
Enough said perhaps. My top ten opened up cinema to a teenager bred largely on escapist Bollywood entertainment. My ten, I am convinced, are a must for anyone who dares to attempt writing a literate film review. After all, they form the alphabet of cinema anywhere in the world. I long to have included a film by Tarkovsky (Sacrifice), Ozu (An Autumn Afternoon), Visconti (The Leopard), Angelopoulos (The Travelling Players), Fassbinder (Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant), Griffith (Broken Blossoms) and Chaplin (Limelight. But yes, these films are the bare essentials in the carrybag kit of any film traveller.

It epitomises all that cinema can be in terms of scope, ambition and narrative power. It shouldn’t make sense, it shouldn’t be such a complete film from such a young, inexperienced moviemaker, but it is.
The Searchers is a movie that balances our sympathy for a murderous racist as he searches both a real and existential landscape for his niece and himself. Ford’s unerring eye for composition makes it the most strikingly beautiful Western in the whole cannon. It’s as if Ford and Wayne had been working up to it for decades. 
La règle du jeu is the most acutely observed and technically accomplished social comedy in cinema. In a rich tableaux, Renoir’s wide-ranging and passionately felt vision is filtered through the most delicious irony. Maybe it could only have been made by a Frenchman. If, as is said, 1939 is the greatest year in film history, this is a good part of the reason why.
Dr. Strangelove is as harsh and dark an anti-war commentary as the cinema has produced. Moving back and forth between its three main locations, the comedy and suspense feed off each other as Kubrick builds a monumental treatise on the destiny of man. 
8½ is the best of all films about filmmaking. Having set out to make something different and having found himself creatively blocked, Fellini noted the reaction – of collaborators, the media, producers and the public – and made it a richly resonant treatise on the artist’s relationship with his art.
It is necessary to have a Hitchcock and Vertigo, that bleak, cynical examination of guilt and obsession, presents the Master Of Suspense at the top of his game. One of those great movies that was underappreciated on first release, it has since grown in stature and influence to such an extent that it now mocks that initial reception. 
Lawrence Of Arabia is, of course, the functioning definition of epic cinema, the idea of a personal story told with integrity and set against a background of social and political upheaval. As with all these films, it has measured itself positively against the harshest critic: time itself.
 “That’s my family, Kay, it’s not me.” When Michael Corleone utters these words to his WASP girlfriend at his sister’s wedding in The Godfather he is setting up the sequel as certainly as if it had all been pre-planned. The second movie is an answer to this line of dialogue, an operatic crime melodrama that seems to cover all the great themes of classical drama. 
Raging Bull is a ferocious examination of Scorsese’s constant theme – men and male values – delivered with a towering command of cinema. The scene in which Jake La Motta beats the prison cell wall and cries that he is not an animal is as poignant and dramatically powerful as anything we have seen in cinema.
Some Like It Hot is a spritely farce and well-honed cross-dressing comedy, but most of all it is the ultimate star vehicle in which Marilyn Monroe and the film camera make love to one another.

Snow is a small but perfectly formed piece of filmmaking, an exhilarating marriage of sound and image (and with trains and extreme weather conditions – what more could anyone want?). Marie Antoinette is much maligned but I think it’s beautifully made and its style perfectly suits its subject. Pandora’s Box = Louise Brooks, enough said (well, actually Pabst is a pretty brilliant director too). Kind Hearts and Coronets is my favourite Ealing film, like All About Eve, its sly wit makes me laugh. Sunrise is technically stunning and is silent filmmaking at its best. Listen to Britain is touching and poignant yet typically British in its understatement, while from its opening scene, L’Armee des ombres is both completely gripping and utterly bleak. It also has the most horrible murder scene ever. As with Powell and Pressburger, it’s hard to choose just one Hitchcock film, especially as selecting a Hollywood film means ignoring his incredible British output (or vice versa).

Ford, the man behind The Searchers, is cinema, as Aeschylus or Sophocles are tragedy. Sunrise is a masterpiece of visual music – and it’s the movie that introduced viewers to the notion of film as art. By the Bluest of Seas is an ethology of the euphoric human body and the most unclassifiable Soviet film ever.

I’m honored to participate in this important survey, which I very much support, but I have a suggestion you’ve probably heard before: given that cinema is much older and more various than when Sight & Sound began compiling votes for ten films, wouldn’t it make sense to expand the voting to 20?

As repeatedly and gracefully proved by Raoul Ruiz, the space for pushing the envelope and re-examining cinematic boundaries is always vast, and the rules are never fixed; in my personal canon, Ruiz’s La ville des pirates has achieved as firm a place as Un chien andalou has in the ‘official’ history of the medium. 
Dreyer’s Gertrud, in my opinion, makes a persuasive case of how magnificent an artform cinema can be. Jonathan Rosenbaum once confessed he had been writing an article about it for over a year, so granted, I don’t believe my tiny blurb would do the film justice. I couldn’t, however, help but place Gertrud alongside Manoel de Oliveira’s most Dreyerian feature, which employs sparse visuals and a humble approach when dealing with miracles as a subject for discussion and scrutiny. 
Being just as much of a chamber piece, Black Rose depicts the collapse of the Soviet empire in a fashion that is both intimate and epic, its scope restricted to but one set. Solovyov has made a name for himself as a filmmaker infallibly in touch with the zeitgeist, and yet what I treasure the most about him is his deeply felt sympathy for the characters, his generosity of spirit. Speaking of generosity, Pered sudom istorii, another humane classic about another collapse (this time, of the Tsarist Russia), blends fiction and non-fiction to defy the conventions of communist propaganda and give the floor to the opposing White Guard. Initially conceived as an ode to the totalitarian regime, it was instead fleshed out as a sort of remake of Ermler’s silent masterpiece, Oblomok Imperii (1929). Likewise, Philippe Garrel revisits his thematic roots of decades earlier in Les amants réguliers. As a 20-year-old involved in the May 1968 protest, he was already making wonderful films; as a seasoned veteran, he is back where he started, except the protagonist is now played his son. Serving as time machines to close the gaps between eras, Ermler’s and Garrel’s films invite us to reconsider our traditional perception of temporality.
Pasolini’s favorite and the most important film to emerge from France in the 1970s, Vecchiali’s Femmes femmes, in a way, makes for another companion piece to Black Rose. When French cinema seemed so frightened by the Nouvelle Vague-introduced vibrant street realism that it sought refuge in cramped apartments that were most conducive to the confessional stylings of, say, La maman et la putain, Vecchialli switched from old-fashioned comedy to musical to borderline tragedy within four walls. His pace is so brisk it’s hard to keep up with the characters, who are completely unafraid of causing discomfort, delivering a punchline that falls flat or putting the audience ill at ease. Indeed, films so poignant and so unapologetically raw in their emotional appeal are few and far between. 
Linked to Femmes femmes by the amazing thespian Sonia Saviange, Le théâtre des matières, a modest, conceptually unadorned picture, foreshadows the latter and marks the beginning of a trilogy that continues with Saltimback, again by Biette, and 36 vues du Pic Saint Loup by the great Jacques Rivette (his unfinished cycle, Les filles du feu, would have been on this list if it went above ten). At the same time we could call it prequel to Femmes femmes. An astonishing film critic and the co-founder (with Serge Daney) of Trafic magazine, Biette has so far failed to gain recognition as a director. This is a terrible oversight. After all, he possessed a unique voice, both sarcastic and down to earth, and a gift for simple storytelling that spoke of complex things: one’s vocation and mission, perseverance and being haunted by one’s past. 
Serge Daney once called Neapolitanische Geschichten a series of disappointments in the great narratives that used to nurture post-war Italian cinema. Disappointment, indeed, seems to be the most accurate word to describe this movie and the late 1970s altogether; no one, however, could hold a candle to Werner Schroeter when it came to filming decline and fall.

Deliberately not listed as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, since none of the sequels, prequels or whateverquels came even remotely near its power, influence and vision.
My Neighbour Totoro because it is the perfect animated film, simple without being simplistic. Because it is less aggressively manipulative than Disney’s animations and more imaginative in style. It won out against Spirited Away because the latter, while also extremely beautiful and well made, does not have its purity.
Many screwball comedies seem a little like Shakespeare’s fools to me – people may have once thought they were funny, but today it’s hard to see why. Not Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife. I think this is the marriage comedy for the ages.
The Godfather: Part II because it is the best family film, a Greek tragedy set in a 20th-century Mafia clan. That’s why it wins over Martin Scorsese’s Mafia films: it balances organised crime against the Corleone family tragedy, which enables us to identify that much more with the characters – and wonder at our own morals.
La Jetée is still the short film that best embodies what short film can do better than feature-length films: it tells a complex story in a condensed way that leaves much to our imagination, uses a visual style that you could never uphold over feature length (at least not without getting boring) but which is perfectly employed here, and at 28 minutes it is exactly the right length.
Lawrence of Arabia because it’s the epic of epics.
Festen because Dogme 95, though not very long lived, was an interesting concept that reintroduced an element of simplicity into the movies, not just in Denmark, and also because I think that this is the film in which the Dogme rules were realised most perfectly.
If you are going to think of the greatest films of ALL time – apart from the fact that this is an impossible task anyway – you should at least include one silent film. In Germany, this automatically leads to the expressionist films, and Nosferatu is the best.
2001: A Space Odyssey because of the match-cut from bone to orbiter, because of its soundtrack, because of the first iPad ever, because of the endless possibilities of interpretation.
The White Ribbon is beautifully shot, brilliantly written and acted, but above all a moral film that proposes a theory about the roots of evil in human beings. Where does the incomprehensible cruelty of war, the Holocaust or, today, terrorism come from? The White Ribbon raises the question and is also an outstanding film. A rare combination!

Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of style and a new way of approaching cinema created by a very young director. Doctor Zhivago saw David Lean at his best with a film made from a Russian novel.

It is inexhaustible. After tens and even hundred of screenings, it remains complex, beautiful and touching.
The gorgeously nuanced color of Blue Velvet, running the gamut from super saturation to desaturation and all points inbetween, summoning the power of numerous genres while being bracketed by none of them, speaks of America as nothing else can. It radiates a Blakean insight into the multiple levels of innocence and the wonder/horror of sexuality, community, family and love. A balance between dark and light is always Lynch’s goal, and it is gloriously achieved here.
Cinema de Papa, Cinema de Schmapa! Renoir is years ahead of the New Wave in La bete humaine with his location shooting, natural lighting, mastery of black and white images, indeterminacy and excavation of the struggle to be free. They never caught up.
Inland Empire will be cutting edge a hundred years from now. Leaping into digital storytelling, Lynch harvests metaphors from cutting-edge quantum mechanics to liberate film from the old Newtonian perameters of time and space. In doing so, he tells a tale of how creativity can assert itself even in the belly of the beast, Hollywood. Delivering into film history a stunning performance from Laura Dern that should have won her an Oscar, or at least a nomination, Lynch excavates the roots of female power and the mysteries of male entitlement with blazing originality.
In the Mood for Love is built on rapture, ecstasy, and the suffering it entails – on wheels. Blasting away all the conventions of melodrama, Wong comes up with a fiction of emotions powered by music (melos) that leaves everyone else in the dust. For fluidity, color, editing, music and unforgettable romance, this is it.
Lady From Shanghai is arguably Welles’ most underrated film. The funhouse scene alone places this film in the pantheon of the best films of all time, but there’s so much more: a timeless portrait of ‘La Belle Dame Sans Merci’; a searing look inside the cogs and wheels of the American socio-economic machine; a priceless image of justice American style; its stunning location panoramas; and Welles and the cinematic goddess Rita Hayworth at their best. 
Once Upon a Time in America is arguably the best gangster film ever made. This not to downgrade the collected performances of James Cagney, which constitute the definitive media gangster scrapbook of genre protagonists. However, as a whole this film brings to bear all the poignance, brutality, selfishness and altruism of America that is central to the gangster genre, with the clarity only an outsider can have. The music alone is a lesson in how soundtracks work at their best.
Top Hat is arguably the definitive movie musical. The engine of the film is of course Astaire and Rogers, not Sandrich, but it is a perfect synthesis of book, music and movement. The dance routines may well be the most heart-stopping evocation of sex on screen in the history of the medium.
Umberto D is the perfect neorealist film. With its non-professional star, its locations, its devastating portrait of the problems of aging, the modern lack of concern for the poor and the eternal power of fascist elements in society, it outdoes King Lear in many ways. Nor has there ever been a use of an animal onscreen to rival Flike. Forget Asta, Flike is the real ancestor of the irresistible wonder dog in The Artist, though of course Flike brings us much closer to the nitty gritty of existence.
 What becomes a legend most? Vertigo is Hitchcock’s greatest cinematic achievement in a field of numerous amazing candidates. It is a seemingly effortless autopsy of American gender relations and general power politics wrapped up in a visual and auditory sumptuousness that takes my breath away. Who else could have made so much of Kim Novack and released the inner demons of Jimmy Stewart? America is dead, long live America. O brave Hollywood that it can allow for such glory as this.

By the end of the screening, the film seems to be all but looking back at us with an amused little smirk. Hitchcock defines the movies; Rear Window defines Hitchcock.
Cinema is both a retreat and a prison in Davies’ The Long Day Closes, a memoir of childhood bliss slowly turning into scary gay desire that the protagonist doesn’t know how to handle. A love song that is also a dirge, it’s a profoundly sad work of immense beauty.
Malick’s Whitman-by-way-of-Emerson poem of beauty intertwined with death, The Thin Red Line is as boundless as it is instantly accessible (not to mention totally immersive). Edited in accordance with the world’s hidden heartbeat that Malick seems completely attuned to, it never fails to intoxicate me, no matter how often I see it.
No one merged emotional mush with slapstick brilliance in quite the same way at Chaplin in City Lights – you can be angry at the movie for tugging at your heartstrings, but you stand no chance of resisting its pull.
WR: Mysteries of the Organism is the only movie that managed to accommodate and satirise all the Cold War chasms at once, and do so in a happy-collage way that’s as ingenious as it is brilliant.
“Unfinished” only in the most crude of senses, A Day in the Country is a work that overflows with emotion, to the point of drugging the viewer into an uncontrolled reverie.

L’Atalante is cinema as a diaphanous waft of half-dreamed desire; the most beautiful erotic dream ever put on film.

Once you admit this, you realise that (almost) everything goes. At a point, I thought of only naming films made in 1939 – as the world was torn apart by the beginning of the Second World War, cinema could not bear to remain encapsulated in the dreamland it had created for itself. It was still rooted in a classic legacy but glimpsing the darker tones of what we came to call ‘modernity’, and some of the most powerful and dilacerated films ever made come from that period. I abandoned that idea in favour of a broader look at the ‘classical age’ (roughly 1915-1960, bookended in my list by Griffith and Bresson), with ten films that, I think, show us how cinema embarked on the mission of being ‘modern’ right from the onset of ‘classicism’. Sorry, but I couldn’t make it without an eleventh film, call it a joker: Godard’s Film Socialisme. I add it for a number of reasons, the least important of them not being that, in a way, it’s 1939 again."

Three names synthesise the evolutionary arch of this cinema. The incarnation of the most universal myth of the 20th century, Chaplin, represents better than anyone else the artistic splendour of his creative plenitude, whilst Rossellini’s realist gaze contemplates history from a purely humanist perspective; and the work of Godard, admirer and tributary of both, delves in greater depth into cinema’s own self-reflection.

Hawks and Ray, both utmost exponents of the auteur theory, represent two opposite poles of the cinematographic activity. The powerful, pragmatic intelligence of Hawks transforms his oeuvre into an unquestionable moral proposal, whilst the personal fragility of Ray transmits the maximum poetic intensity to his oeuvre.

The films by Mizoguchi, Renoir and Lang, in their human and artistic development, represent the expressive and thematic summit of their fully realised works, whilst the truncated careers of Guru Dutt and Murnau blossom as if in almost premonitory bursts of tragic emotion.
Undoubtedly, some other films such as Dreyer’s Ordet or Jean Vigo’s L’Atalante, and auteurs such as Hitchcock, McCarey or Bresson, could figure in this list too.

Karen Oughton,440,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/440,academic,UK,Female,critics poll,"Visiting lecturer, media communications; freelance film journalist",10,"My list reflects a variety of film genres and comprises of classics, moderns and some overlooked gems. I have tried to be objective in terms of assessing films either from an academic film-theory perspective or by considering their cultural impact.
Cinema-as-craft is represented through Vivre sa vie. Godard dissects his damsel, Nana, through camera angles and music that give the scarlet lady a deep yet cold mystery that lends an intriguing eroticism. 
Second is Citizen Kane. While the film occasionally suffers from the technical restrictions of its age, the sweeping long shots contrast with Welles’ performance to give a superb feel of the world of the title character and bring the era to life. Vertigo also contains technological advances, but adds to them a truly skin-crawling and altogether heartbreaking plot, complete with superb acting from the leads.
Dog Day Afternoon is included for its frenetic shots of Al Pacino’s thief, Sonny, running through the bank, contrasting the character’s attempt to keep the situation under control while Brooklyn and the world outside the bank’s door turns to a leering, laughing circus. 
Cinema’s ability to affect its audience is the reason for my final few choices. The New York Ripper’s decidedly nasty narrative is accentuated by the more infamous scenes and the heartless backstory to act as existential nihilism as much as an old hacks’ horror. Furthermore, the controversial A Serbian Film is, I must confess, my favourite film. It presents some of the darkest human impulses as somewhat desireable and dares to posit its plot as a political allegory that contains real emotional punch – I cried in the press screening. It is a film that affects horror fanatics and mainstream viewers alike – my students simply stated that it is impossible to un-see. 
It therefore makes oddly logical sense to include Monty Python’s Life of Brian as a comedy containing a serious message, an irresitably silly singalong and enough blasphemy to cause controversy across the world. 
Alternatively, some films unite their audiences. Mary Poppins is a family film that evokes shared affections and festivities while incorporating adult themes and animation, while The Shawshank Redemption conveys a strong message of self-determinism. Finally, as a nod to cult film fans everywhere, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a barking mad example of how cinema affects an audience that can then take the strangest theme and bring it, Rocky-like, to life for generations to come.

In spite of that prejudice, I’ve selected some more recent films. 
The Passion of Joan of Arc is silent cinema in its maturity. Almost abstract, Dreyer’s film is a pure delight of audiovisual form.
For almost a decade, cinema and TV exploited the urban decadence following the path Lang set with M. Its mirroring of the underground and aboveground societies is a striking and inspiring political metaphor even now.
My Darling Clementine is the most classic of the Hollywood classics, John Ford at his best, in a film that discusses how democracy emerges from a state of wilderness. Rich and complex, it’s a film that Shakespeare would have loved.
Is there such a thing as leftist Western? Yes, there is. The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a film that undermines the American Dream and shows devastating consequences of poverty.
Some of the neorealist classics work well today, some don’t. Umberto D. works best of all.
Un condamne a mort s’ e echappe is a mix of a beautifully crafted thriller and a philosophical film about death, fear and mercy. It’s also my personal number one.
The Round-Up shows history as a clash of anonymous, depersonalised forces and society as a prison with no visible walls, only abstract nothingness of puszta. Jancso’s classic is a visual equivalent of the Marxist concept of history, made through highly original film language.
Duelis the definitive film about modernity, with a dematerialised, abstract Other and menacing machines.
Satantango is the most ambitious film of the greatest of contemporary classics.
The Death of Mr Lazarescu is the best example of the new, 21st-century minimalism. Misunderstood as a film about the Eastern European health system, Lazarescu is something more: a film about definite solitude of death.

List making of this sort is an impossible and fearful task. The only Sight & Sound top tens I ever noticed in previous decades were the little self-portraits in list form, rather the ones striving toward some grand canonical presentation – the half-forgotten polaroid in a drawer rather than the commandment from on high. Small movements or gestures in films – moments of unlikely energy, reflection, emptying or light – can affect you way out of proportion to their supposed ‘importance’. Or, as Manny Farber might have it – the vigour and surprise of “termite art” over the smugness and excess of “white elephant art”.

Olivier Père,235,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/235,programmer,France,Male,critics poll,"Artistic director, Festival del film Locarno",10,"Murnau is one of those rare total geniuses of cinema and made some of the finest films in the world. Sunrise, alongside Tabu, may be his masterpiece.
Dying in a car accident before the advent of sound and the talkies, Murnau was undoubtedly the first major genius of cinema, and the last of the great German Romantics. His vast knowledge of painting, theatre, architecture and philosophy enabled him to realise a perfect work of art that is complete at every level, both in terms of formal execution and thematics, yet it is a purely cinematic creation, in no way dependant on the pre-existing arts. Murnau was a filmmaker whose intelligence enabled him to combine the idea of cinematic movement with that of pictorialism to utterly compelling effect. Made in the US, Sunrise transcends the Manichean games of expressionism through the magical fluidity of its lighting.
The Testament of Doctor Mabuse belongs to a transitional phase in Lang’s filmography: he made only three films between his great silent period and his exile to Hollywood. As with M, we are confronted with an impressive mastery of the dramatic use of sound elements and an incredible feeling for action and suspense. The supernatural sequences still retain all their terrifying dreamlike precision. A filmmaker who was a master of portraying men as victims of their destinies, Lang also introduced the most omnipotent of criminal characters.
A Day in the Country is an unfinished film (it lasts only 40 minutes), Partie de campagne is, however, an exemplary literary adaptation, as well as an audacious and free cinematic masterpiece. It is easy to understand what appealed to Renoir in Maupassant’s short story: a young woman’s entirely natural awakening of the senses, the sensuality that breaks out of the stifling confines of the family, and above all the river, sweeping its characters before it like logs pulled along by the current, to more or less happy outcomes. Only Renoir has managed to express on film the most elevated notion of naturalism, examining this world from a perspective that is dark, cruel but objective, before going on to achieve the serenity of the work of his old age, joyously pantheistic, such as Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe, an optimistic and late counterpoint to Partie de campagne in which eroticism is finally seen as a source of happiness. And then there is Sylvia Bataille, an unearthly eruption whose angelic aura transcends the bourgeois mediocrity that surrounds her. She is on the verge of womanhood, floating between earth and sky – the scene in which the two friends watch her on the swing has a vertiginous effect on the viewer that is not wholly attributable to the speed of movement – with the most staggering look into the camera in film history. She has that modernity of an instinctive actress, whose performance immediately dates that of her fellow actors. With Renoir, one has no qualms about using superlatives: if great films are always documentaries about actors, Partie de campagne is his greatest film.
La règle du jeu is quite simply the greatest French film by the greatest of French directors. Jean Renoir shot is between the Munich Agreement and the start of the war, wanting to give an account of the state of mind of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. “It seemed to me that one way of interpreting the state of mind of society at that moment was to deliberately not talk about the situation but to tell an entertaining story, and so I sought inspiration in Beaumarchais, Marivaux, in classical authors, in comedy.” Even if he subscribed to the pessimistic trend in French cinema of the time, La règle du jeu was, for a long time, a ‘film maudit’, subject to a stream of abuse and cut to ribbons. Through its sudden changes of tone, its complex structure and above all the diversity of the cast and their performances, this masterpiece, which is both serious and lighthearted, was rejected by critics and audiences alike. It was not until the 1950s that cinéphiles voted La règle du jeu one of the greatest films in film history. Renoir uses the mechanisms of vaudeville to portray a moribund society, filming the dance of desire that drives its characters, who represent the different social classes, gathered in a château in Sologne. The “little catastrophes”, betrayals and cuckoldries lead to the death of one of the protagonists, an outsider to this mouldering world. This almost ridiculous social upset prefigures that of another on a far bigger scale: the collapse of pre-Second World War society.
Ernst Lubitsch’s masterpiece To Be or Not to Be differs from all the anti-Nazi propaganda films made in Hollywood in the wonderful subtlety of its script and the numerous issues raised, including that of the couple and the theatre. The most famous Shakespearean soliloquy, of crucial importance to the narrative, gives Lubitsch’s film its true meaning. It is a matter of being (or not being) free, being intelligent or not, resisting or not. Here Lubitsch delivers his hedonistic philosophy of life. Freedom of desire, freedom of ideas and political freedom are inseparable; love for women and the theatre are set in opposition to the Nazis’ barbarity and stupidity.
Via several dramatic and fantastic stories set in 16th century feudal Japan, Ugetsu monogatari is a film of extraordinary power and accuracy about the human condition. The greatest of Japanese filmmakers, in his films Mizoguchi expresses perfectly the universality of an art that is however rooted in Japanese culture and history. It is the apogee of film classicism. 
John Ford, beyond a doubt the greatest of American directors, (and one of the greatest in the world) produced a body of work of incredible scope and richness. The elegiac The Searchers is one of its high points. 
Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock’s finest cinematic poem and a seminal film in cinema history, both an anomaly in terms of Hollywood production and an infinite source of wonder and inspiration for future generations.
In Le Mépris, during the shooting of a film adaptation of Odysseus, directed by Fritz Lang in Italy, the wife of a French screenwriter becomes increasingly alienated from her husband and admits to him the contempt he inspires in her. One of the finest films ever made about both coupledom and the cinema, Le Mépris is also – with good reason – Godard’s most mythical film, in which he allows himself a degree of lyricism that was only to resurface again in much later work (Nouvelle vague, 1990).
In 1973, following The Damned and Death in Venice, Luchino Visconti concluded his German Trilogy with Ludwig, about Louis II of Bavaria, from his coronation (1864) to his death (1886). Ludwig has a deconstructed narrative and offers multiple perspectives on a central protagonist who is both historical and secret, enigmatic, elusive (even if, in the end, the film establishes the director’s viewpoint). Visconti steadily brings out from the shadows those who promulgated the official discourse on Ludwig after his death (mad, ill, irresponsible, unfit to rule, decadent), but the filmmaker implicitly designates them as assassins of the monarch, who was found mysteriously drowned. Helmut Berger, Visconti’s lover and the lead actor here, embodies a poetic Ludwig who is a dreamer and a visionary, and conjures the performance of a lifetime. The titanic shoot delivered a monster of a film, without a doubt the director’s most brilliant work, but which proved to be, once again, a financial disaster. The film suffered drastic editing for international distribution and it was only after Visconti’s death that we were able to see this spectacular film in its full four-hour version.

Essentialise to ten to render a bastard art ‘important’ or ‘great’ — the bottom line for intellectual consumption — and how could it be?
At the point where movies no longer veil reality but plot it, what could be more important than the unimportant films of William Wellman and Ken Jacobs that take their marginality and bastardisation as a starting point? They offer a ground-level reimagining of those subjects/subjections of style, story, society, serving to command, and purifying the world into a single voice — a set of terms for reality that the camera has been able to affirm like no other medium. Westward the Women, Times Squared, Lancelot du Lac, The Love of the Actress Sumako, Khrustalyov My Car, The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse, Tih Minh and The Loom stay stuck on the margins, and a canon only creates new standards.
The purpose of this list is clearly promotion, but whether it’s promotion of one’s own alignment with camps of taste or of a few movies that could challenge these, might be open to debate. It could be that dumbness is the only dissolution to a dumb discourse, if only our generation can slough off the figures that made films ‘matter’ and make all this stuff matters of a conversation, the flipside of life, passed and traded among networks of a few friends with the luxury to care – films made among friends, love as a surplus value of a transmogrified, traded-in reality: real luxuries, when not immune from history. Only time can untell — stay tuned. Maybe, like these movies, notes for self in a public forum. Anyway, a crash course as a map of the terrain.

The Great Dictator sees Chaplin as prophet and is the best politics-and-laughter as terrorism achievement in cinema against Nazism. Dr Strangelove is so horribly funny, and has a real global dimension.
Imitation of Life is the most beautiful melodrama ever filmed; emotionally it is so strong, and is a masterpiece of mise en scène from the first sequence on the beach to the funeral of the black mother. Only imbecils think Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bachis boring; it is the best biopic about a musician ever filmed in Europe, even if it is really something else: a bio-cinematic force, a real sound of music, an homage to the artist as a worker and to his supporting wife. Jungle Freaks is sad and hilarious tropics, incredibly funny and serious, and displays the sensational courage of filming in the middle of a military dictatorship. La maison des bois is a six-hour TV film about the protection of children during First World War by a nice family in the country: war is horrible, but being a lonely child during one may be worse, so that this film is like an oasis of tenderness in the Pialat’s generally very black universe.
La Marseillaise is the most generous and intelligent film about the French Revolution. Filmed during ‘Front Populaire’ in France with high degree of historical oportunism and courage, it presents Louis XVI, as interpreted by Renoir’s brother, as a very nice man. Le Mépris has always been my favorite Godard. It is the pinnacle of something, and is so beautifully inspired by classical Greco-German-Roman culture. It is even dedicated to Fritz Lang as a master.
Do I to justify The Searchers? I might have chosen ten or more other John Ford films, but this one is special: it reaches so deep into the heart of America, and is a peak in John Wayne’s career.

Jean Epstein’s last silent film The Fall of the House of Usher reflects upon vision, time, rhythm and human representation to produce something hypnotically fascinating with unprecedented cinematic power.
Positioned at the centre of its director’s career, and at the edge of two very different decades, The Cry depicts an individual crisis that mirrors the general collapse of a mode of production and representation, on the one hand revealing a transformation of reality, and on the other questioning its very status.
M is based on highly varied editing patterns, simultaneously portraying the individual and urban condition, experimenting with brilliant combinations of sound and image to become one of the most remarkable achievements of the Weimar era.
Among the major achievements of the silent era, Vertov’s masterpiece The Man with the Movie Camera represents a challenge of both image and concept, expanding the range of possibilities and combinations. 
Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is among the most remarkable achievements of silent era. It perfectly represents the combination of German (and Murnau’s) technical and visual achievements and skills with the power of Hollywood productions and supposedly universal morals.
Une femme est une femme contains Godard’s conceptual density, packaged in a smart and amusing way. It is both an homage to Anna Karina’s beauty, experienced through the cinematic skin itself (widescreen, Eastmancolor), and a tribute to classical Hollywood comedy – without worrying about narrative verisimilitude.
Some Like It Hot is a perfect movie, since it explains that nobody’s perfect.
Vampyr is a ghost story told by cinematic ghosts – a subjective camera, double exposures, overexposures – to tell a story of passion and purification.

This list does not want to create any canon, it merely reflects a particular moment in my life – perhaps tomorrow I will write a different list. I think that in order to create a list like this, intuition is the proper tool. I have chosen films that are exceptional but that do not fit in the usual category of ‘masterpieces’. I think that excessive perfection is somehow sterile, so I prefer to vote for films that take risks. That’s the reason why my list opens with the beginning of modern cinema – Journey to Italy by Roberto Rossellini – and ends with Inland Empire by David Lynch, a film open to future cinema. For the same reason, I have chosen the unfinished film A Day in the Country by Jean Renoir, instead of his great masterpiece La regle du jeu. I also voted for Orson Welles’ F for Fake instead of Citizen Kane because it asks some questions that are the seed of postmodernist debates around the copying and the recycling of materials. I have always been very interested on Jean Luc Godard’s films, but I have chosen Passion and not his other much more acclaimed films because it is a film about the difficulties of achieving perfection in cinema, reminding us that cinema is an artform that is always dependent on the chaos of life. I have saved some films by beloved filmmakers like Charles Chaplin, Carl Dreyer or Luchino Visconti for another list of works that are probably closer to perfection."

It was very tempting to include Ray’s Apu Trilogy on this list, but that would have consumed three votes.

Even though the Redux version of Apocalypse Now added footage and extra depth to Coppola’s masterpiece, the original cut remains one of the greatest films simply because it is tonally brilliant, with not a false note anywhere.

Though the effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey may seem humdrum today in the light of advanced technology, no other science-fiction film can capture the majesty and the nothingness of space, plus a sense of the existence of a supreme otherworldly power, that Kubrick achieved.
Detractors may carp about Attenborough presenting a roseate view of the Mahatma Gandhi and the omission of some negative facts about him, but his film remains a grand journey populated, literally, by a cast of thousands, and guarantees moist eyes by the end of it.
La Dolce Vita is a wonderful snapshot of Roman society at the time, a sneering look at hedonism and at the same time an exploration of human emptiness.
The austere flip side to Fellini’s exuberance, with L’Avventura Antonioni practically wrote the book on disconnection.
Though derivative of Kurosawa and Leone, in Sholay Sippy crafted a faultless curry Western that set the bar for action, emotion and comedy – it has gone unrivalled in Indian popular cinema.
Ironically, in Ikiru Kurosawa finds an affirmation of life from his protagonist who is doomed to die.
Since there is no rule that says commercial cinema cannot be included in lists of the great and the good, Raiders of the Lost Ark makes it on to this one for its sheer joie de vivre and the fact that no action adventure since has managed to even come close to Spielberg’s masterpiece.

It is impossible to encapsulate in only 10 films all the pleasure, the intense and chilling moments that I’ve had from cinema. However, I take the challenge to list my ten favourite films as a game, conscious that I could make a different list every day, depending on my state of mind and the memories that would rush to my head. Maybe only one film would remain untouchable: Gertrud. The order I propose is the year of production. This way, I free myself of the difficult and unpleasant task of sorting the films in order of preference.
The Last Laugh: for me, it was essential to include in this list one work by Murnau and one of the so-called German “expressionist” films. It could have been Nosferatu, but in the end I went for this sad story and Emil Jannings’ great performance.
Late Spring: almost any Ozu film would be among my favourite ones. Especially those with Chishû Ryú and Setsuko Hara.  Emotion in its purest state.  This is pioneering cinema, a cinema that neither reproduces nor pays homage to any previous cinema.  Every time I see this film, my eyes fill with tears at moments that don’t seem created to do that. Ozu’s cinema has something that goes straight to the heart.
The Big Heat: film noir is my favourite genre, so a film made during the golden age of the Hollywood studios had to make it onto the list. A superb script and great actors: Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin, amongst others.
Plácido: Berlanga gave us some of the most beautiful and funniest films of Spanish cinema. I chose this ironic and tender story that speaks as much about the hypocrisy of human beings as their ability to help each other to survive. The film has a cast full of outstanding, yet often undervalued, actors and actresses, such as José Luis López Vázquez, Manuel Aleixandre, Cassen, Elvira Quintillá, José María Cafarell and Fernando Delgado, amongst others.
The Silence: I saw it when I was a young man in post-Franco Spain, a country longing to regain the freedom that the dictator had snatched away for 40 years. The film disturbed me a lot – its sad sexuality, its incredible black and white cinematography by the master Sven Nykvist, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnel Lindblom’s performances, Europe at war, the tanks in the streets, and the silence of God and men crushing everything.
Gertrud: the most beautiful film about love I’ve ever seen. A masterpiece about the need for and the impossibility of love. My list had to include a film by this great director. There could have been even more than one…
Belle de jour: one of the greatest gems of eroticism on film, ever. Catherine Deneuve (always beautiful) has never been as beautiful as in this picture, when her lover whips her as she’s tied to a tree, before handing her over to the servants.
My Neighbor Totoro: a beautiful ode to nature, family, childhood, friendship. There are very few examples of animation films apparently addressed to children that manage to be so adult. Ghibli studios could be represented in this list by several other films, by Miyazaki himself or by Isao Takahata.
The Nightmare Before Christmas: the soundtrack composed by Elfman; the universe created by Burton with dead people full of life; and Jack Skellington, a character that has already become part of film history in his own right – all are unforgettable.
The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun: this medium-length feature is the African film that has impressed me the most. The story of a little girl, suffering from polio, who struggles to find her place amongst the street children who are selling newspapers, manages to convey emotion without ever becoming overtly sentimental. I like each of the few films that Mambéty has directed. Too bad he died too soon."

They represent cinema as a deep experience. I have seen all of these ten films at least five times (some of them 15 times) and they always affected me as they did the first time (well, maybe not as much, but pretty close to). Their power remains untouchable over the years. Even if I watched them when I was 12, 25 or 37 years old (my age in 2012), I could relate to them every single time. And I believe they will still have the most impact on me when I reach my elder years.
Of course, I lament the absence of film directors that should be considered among the greatest of all time –Hitchcock, Ford, Bresson, Rossellini, Ozu, Eastwood, Kubrick, Buñuel, Marker, Tarkovsky, Resnais, Antonioni, Scorsese – but none of their films have touched me as much as these ones did. I would have voted for Godard’s Histoire(s) du cinéma if I could have take the eight chapters as a group, but rules are rules, and anyway Godard’s pieces were intentionally made for television, not cinema. My only concession to a ‘minor’ filmmaker goes to Pennebakers’ Dont Look Back, which is my concesion to Bob Dylan, the greatest living artist on earth. And, as I said, this is a list of personal epiphanies, ten films that are treasure mementos of unbelievable joy and/or wonderment.

They all are, of course – for all our vaunted and very special cinephiliac sensibilities, the importance of films is fixed in the moment in our lives at which we see them, whether in a classroom, a drive-in, a rep house, a festival or on a plane, a computer screen or, gasp, an iPhone. Our age at that moment is crucial: I was imprinted with Vertov and with Daisies at a moment when cinematic language was changing radically, and these films from the former Soviet Union were key to fusing artistic bravura with political reach.
As I came of age as a film addict, a feminist and a lesbian, attuned to the aesthetics of my age, Potter, Julien and Borden were equally crucial in demonstrating how thrillingly cinema could write the templates of identity. Of sexuality too, though here Wong Kar-wai and Dennis are equally influential on that front. Ah, Tilda Swinton in a sleigh, Maggie Cheung in a cafe, and Honey on the radio dial! For my generation, Latin America was the great battleground and the land of promise. Gutiérrez Alea’s long-misunderstood masterpiece defined a new Latin American cinema, just as Guzman’s more recent essay film did all over again. And Sweet Sweetback? In that there’s a manifesto to be written. Raw and scabrous and packed with too many ideas and energy for one film, it’s the cornerstone of the modern American independent film movement; while it’s Cassavetes who always gets the credit, it’s Van Peebles who is its uncredited founder, linking together low-budget production, non-union crews, sexploitation and the French New Wave into one combustible whole.
OK, I’m broken hearted now. No Fassbinder? No Claire Denis? No Tsai Ming-liang? No The Third Man? No Lucrecia Martel? No Yvonne Rainer? No Tropical Malady? No Teknolust? Gus Van Sant, missing? Todd Haynes? Varda? Beau Travail? This is truly hopeless. It is for this very reason I usually turn down these wretched list-making opportunities. I have reluctantly given in, this time, and I regret it already. Please forgive me.

On its 60th anniversary of compiling the greatest movies ever made, Sight & Sound magazine is soliciting nominations for the Ten Best movies ever. How would you approach the question? Citizen Kane will almost inevitably top the list.
If you define ‘greatest’ as “most influential’, then yes, Citizen Kane. Its deep-focus cinematography and multi-perspective narrative are hugely influential. But just because Saw has influenced a generation of torture-porn films, I wouldn’t put it on my ballot. A best film ever needs something more than influence. It needs universality, staying power and freshness (by those criteria, yes, Citizen Kane). It needs to ravish the viewer visually, narratively and emotionally.
With these criteria in mind, I meditated for five minutes. These are the first ten films that popped in my head: Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia, which introduced the grammar (not to mention the hero worship) of the sports movie; Jean Cocteau’s La belle et la bete, a primal and lyrical telling of an enduring fairytale; Spike Lee’s Malcolm X, which employed four different filmmaking techniques to suggest symphony and coda of an extraordinary life; Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, a timeless allegory of good, evil and urban planning; Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly’s Singin’ in the Rain – pure happiness; Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where action is wedded to emotion; Carol Reed’s The Third Man, a breathtaking moral thriller; Agnès Varda’s Cleo from 5 to 7, the portrait of a woman in real time; Steven Spielberg’s E.T., an ode to wonder and connectedness; Buster Keaton’s Sherlock, Jr., a movie about the magic and possibilities of movies.
No Citizen Kane. No The Godfather. No Vertigo. No Seven Samurai. No Pixar. No worries.
Which criteria would you use? Which movies would be on your list?

A fully realised work of art, she writes, should flow with all nine of these. They are: wonder, joy, sexual pleasure, pity, anguish, anger, terror, disgust and laughter. This idea has guided my thinking.
I dread the weight of canons. This list also grew from a challenge: a contribution to a panel called ‘Five Films to Screen for an Alien’, held in 2011 at the Australian Film and Television School in Sydney. The idea was to explain the history of cinema to an alien (or screen studies student) in five films: itself a challenge derived from Mark Cousins’ assertion that he could illustrate the history of cinema in five films. I was surprised to see how many of the original five – Blade Runner, Rashomon, Some Like it Hot, Werckmeister Harmonies – I chose were about truth, lies and storytelling (and how many were in black and white).

My only criterion for this list is that it’s entirely to do with my own filmgoing history – these are films that have all revealed something new to me at important moments.
There are three new additions. Pierrot le fou replaces Le Mépris, as it’s simply more fun – but I also realised that it was the first Godard I ever saw. Of the two films I’ve discovered in the last decade, Out One was for years my Holy Grail – I thought I’d never see it, and when I did I wasn’t disappointed. It’s still a magnificent blueprint for generating fictions out of the everyday. It impresses me all the more in that even though huge chunks are barely watchable (the theatre sections) it’s nevertheless extraordinary overall.
I’m taking a risk on Apichatpong, as I’m not sure what Syndromes will mean in the long term, but I was bowled over when I saw it – I’m always hoping to sight those rare screen phenomena that French critics like to call UFOs, and this film truly is (at the risk of repeating the Joe cliché) the authentic ‘mysterious object’.
As for an old favourite, Hellzapoppin is still my desert island film, a crammed encyclopedia of meta-farce that continues to crack me up after all these years. Here’s to Olsen & Johnson, the kid sister and “Mrs Jones!!!”

I kept half of the entries from my 2002 list that I couldn’t bear to part with, but, much as it pains me, had to bump a few to make way for changes. That meant losing The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Out of the Past, Rear Window, Sans Soleil and Written on the Wind, all of which are still way up there for me in a list that I find impossible to break down into order of preference.
My appreciation of American movies of the 1970s has only intensified since moving to New York ten years ago, hence the inclusion of three more titles from that decade. And while I struggled to pin down a Scorsese choice, I’ve always been especially partial to Alice – probably his least typical film after Hugo (which left me cold). I also went with an atypical Fellini because I prefer his work when it still carries a whiff of neorealism (I Vitelloni, Cabiria, La Strada, etc) to the later signature-Fellini preiod.
Finally, in a spirit of optimism about the state of movies today that’s probably a little dishonest, I wanted to include one exceptional film from the last decade or so. I narrowed it down to Pan’s Labyrinth, Almodóvar’s All About My Mother (which would have fitted snugly in the spot vacated by Sirk), or Kaurismaki’s Drifting Clouds (has there been a better movie about economic recession since? I doubt it). But I went with del Toro because that movie’s commanding grasp of fantasy, horror and history makes it for me the most masterful piece of screen storytelling of the past ten years. Every frame has both beauty and purpose.

A Day in the Country is the diametric opposite of all my other choices: ‘natural’ cinema, with its technique invisible, subsumed into pure lyricism. Citizen Kane – well… just the individual audacity of it, and craft to bring it off. Day of Wrath has a consummate classically ordered narrative, and uses lighting and camera as moral instruments.

I hadn’t the guts to go that far here, but struggled with another point raised by these examples: whether disparate forms can meaningfully occupy the same list, or would amount to a criminal multiple-category error. Hence, no angst over definition of ‘greatest’ but plenty over definition of ‘film’. I’ve been shamelessly subjective (limiting myself to works mattering much to me personally, albeit ones with qualities that, up to a point and within their genres, are objectively defensible). But in interests of coherence I toyed with restricting myself first to ten features, then to ten shorts and so on, before settling on a clumsy compromise: a merger/edit of three ‘category’ top tens.
So, here we have three fiction features (all Hollywood, as it happens, though culled from ten French, Japanese and British, as well as American titles); four choices from the international canon of non-fiction (one each from Netherlands, USSR, UK and US); and three favourites from the British tradition of short sponsored filmmaking (with which much of my working life happens to have been concerned).
By no means am I making claims for works in this last category being as important or as ‘good’ as those in the others, though the modest Review is, in its way, as moving to me as anything on celluloid – the final issue of what was previously Mining Review, it’s a stiff-lipped swansong to an entire vanishing universe of Keynsian politics, economics and filmmaking. Timothy comes closest to bridging the parallel worlds (an internationally regarded, UK government-sponsored, 40-minute featurette that embraces documentary and dramatic elements). But I doubt meaningful comparison can be made between – rather than within – these forcibly merged mini-lists.
As a top ten, then, this is too egocentric to interest many others, except perhaps by raising one salient point about the past/present/future of ‘film’. The narrative feature’s ascendancy over screencraft of all other forms, lengths and industrial contexts is in inexorable relative decline. I expect most 2012 contributors will happily stick with a 1952 sense of what (in that respect) counts as a ‘film’ worthy of the desert island. I’m less convinced this will be true of 2022’s, still less of 2052’s.

Second, I selected films that challenge the tradition language of cinema and which strongly contributed to the evolution of new genres and forms in cinema history (Greed, Germany, Year Zero, 2001: A Space Odyssey”, Mirror, Close-Up, Shoah). Third, as I’m very interested by the relationship between cinema and history – mostly in connection to the most traumatic event of the 20th century, the Second World War – I choose films that deal with that period and that defy Adorno’s statement: “To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric” (Germany, Year Zero, The Conformist, Shoah).

I can vividly recall the time and place each film was watched: eight of the films were seen in a cinema (the best place for film), and three were in the presence of the directors at amazing venues like Gloria Kino in Kassel and, more locallym at Tyneside Cinema and Star & Shadow Cinema in Newcastle. The list covers a range of approaches and styles across independent cinema and artist film, including structural, optical, documentary, fiction and the magical.
13 Lakes was my first Benning experience and got me hooked on his sublime and witty work, showing how film and sound can expand beyond the cinematic frame.
The features Wanda and A Woman Under the Influence both brilliantly show desperation, loneliness and the fate of strong female leads, both playing the roles of an American housewife and mother in the 1970s, set against the backdrop of industrial and societal change.
Scorpio Rising and The Angelic Conversation are both, in their different ways, cinematic dream worlds, focusing on desire, magic and ritual, and with incredible soundtracks that make them iconic of their eras (1950s and 1960s pop, and 8190s electronic music by Coil).
Blight is also about spirits, the spirits of previous inhabits of demolished houses around the M11 in east London. Reality is fictionalised through editing, making this one of the most powerful films about contemporary British society and displacement.
The subversion of traditional documentary techniques is also at the root of Melancholia, an epic eight-hour feature that needs time and space to unfold its complex story about trauma, identity and revolutionary survival in contemporary Philippines. Melancholia changes our expectations of political film.
Fate and In Vanda’s Room are also, in their different ways, films about the dispossessed and hidden inhabitants of society. These pre- and post-millennium films show European collective anxiety through the stories of immigrants and survivors, while the urban landscape around them collapses.
Dresden Dynamo is a great example of an optical film, and importantly is the one film on the list not to be made with a camera. Created using Letraset on clear celluloid, the sound is completely synchonised, extending the image into the sound frame.

8 ½ plunged the viewer into endless labyrinths of the creative process and put an end to Euclidian notions of linear film narrative.
John Cassavetes. The web of human relations is reproduced by shrewd John Cassavetes in Husbands with the meticulous precision of a micro-surgeon.
The masterpiece Long Farewell nearly vanished into the vaults of banned movies. Outwardly it is a mere family drama, but in essence it is a whimsical, aggressively egocentric poetic pronouncement.
The most personal of Andrey Tarkovsky’s movies, in The Mirror he found a poetic equivalent for the verses of his father Arseny Tarkovsky and convinced the world of the immortality of the great Russian artistic tradition.

So where does the actual list come from? The ten films I selected not only exemplify a cross-section of the medium’s finest achievements – each of them represents the inscription of a space, whether through camera movement, dialectical montage, community ethos, the fixed frame, the porosity of the open frame across a given duration, or some combination thereof.

And there are films that do something you hadn’t seen before, that catch at you and divert you and teach you something you didn’t know: a performance, a move, a feel, a sound, a view, a device. It might be small (it may not). Perhaps it eats through expectation at an odd angle, in a film you anticipated nothing from. Glenn Anders, giggly, perverse and sweaty in Shanghai. The vast, grindingly gorgeous whole-cloth mythology in Pirates III, with the franchise figurines chirruping like ghosts in front of it. Milla Jovovich’s breakneck teenage martyrdom in Messenger, and why the hard-bitten French army is captivated by it. In Rawlinson, the treacle-black surreal concentrate of the history of British comic writing and performance. Walken cracking up in Communion, jerkily hallucinating a silly-weird story of alien abduction that his family prefers to the notion of his being badly mad (as in fact do we). The anti-noir daylight ambience of modern evil in The Long Goodbye, and the innocent, incorruptible drift of Elliott Gould’s honesty, his near-passive soft-shoe refusal.

Some of the films listed significantly changed the landscape of international filmmaking due to technological or stylistic innovation: Citizen Kane, Man with a Movie Camera, Battleship Potemkin and Toy Story (an odd grouping, I know). Citizen Kane combined several technical innovations (eg deep focus, experimental editing techniques) with an entertaining and politically charged narrative that has continued to enthral viewers today. Man With a Movie Camera demonstrated the artistic power of editing in silent film just before sound came and ruined everything. It took at least another 40 years for Hollywood to catch up with Dziga’s experiments from the 1920s. Battleship Potemkin is the most widely watched example of Eisenstein’s dialectical montage films, which challenged the Hollywood style of constructing a film and instead demonstrated the potential for film to create new ideas from the juxtaposition of images. Toy Story may seem like an odd companion to these other two films, but I would argue that it represents as significant a technological leap forward for film. Lasseter’s experiment in computer animation could have remained simply a tech demo, but his passion for classic Disney animation and ability to imbue the simplest characters with emotion meant that he paved the way for CG animation to be the dominant form of animation today.
Other films in my list are there simply because I believe their directors have had a monumental impact on film history, though I can only afford to nominate one of their movies each. Psycho, Blue Velvet and 2001 are in this category; I am torn between nominating them or Rear Window/Vertigo (Hitchcock), Elephant Man/Lost Highway (Lynch), and The Shining/A Clockwork Orange (Kubrick). I also decided to include Psycho, as I believe the horror film genre needs to be represented due to my own personal passion for horror films and their growing influence on mainstream cinema. While some horror purists may argue with whether Psycho classes as a thriller or a horror film, I believe its impact on both genres cannot be understated. And it still scares the willies out of me today!
My list also includes the films that have had the greatest impact on me as a film viewer and on my research into the psychology of film. Wong Kar-wai’s Chungking Express had a huge impact on me when I watched it as a teen. I had never before seen a film so stylish, so immediate, so foreign and so intriguing. Kar-wai’s cool Asian sensibility has had a direct influence on Quentin Tarantino, whose work I also decided to represent with Pulp Fiction. While Reservoir Dogs was his initial shot-in-the-head to Hollywood, Pulp Fiction demonstrated a skill at narrative and characterisation that raised his craft beyond pure shock and into the realms of the great filmmakers. If only all his imitators could replicate Tarantino’s deft touch. Similar mastery of narrative has to be attributed to the Coen Brothers. I would love to include several of their films for their ability to tell funny, engrossing stories in stylish and technically innovative ways. As I can only include one, I chose The Big Lebowski because it is the perfect end-of-the-evening film and always makes me laugh so hard I squirt White Russian out of my nose."

From the impact of the gestures in the bright screen of Joan of Arc to other fine, subtle gestures and elegant movements in the daring and dark of Scarface; from the long and fascinating escape in North by Northwest to the mysterious space and time quotidian of La Notte; from the beautiful explosion of Flaming Creatures to the brilliant dialogues in a simultaneously ironic and sensitive presentation of social melodrama in Palomita Blanca; from the fundamental essay masterpiece Nuit et Bruillard to the deep thesis on memory in film of Histoire(s) du cinéma. From a beautiful black and white of Sicilia! and every word pronounced by its magnificent characters to, finally, Road to Nowhere, an extraordinary mise en abîme which surpasses the limits of every fiction, even those this side of the screen."

Cinema and the world it reflects is constantly evolving, so my list traces what I feel are the best films of their times. But mainly, it’s because these are films that, even now, viewed from a different century, feel as fresh, experimental, relevant, beautiful and thrilling as they must have been when audiences first saw them. Only now we can also call them timeless, and surely that’s the trick of great art – to remain astonishing. These ten films are so brilliant to me that as soon as I see even one scene from them, I have to drop everything – my jaw included – and watch, in thrall to the story and how the director is telling it."

Gimme Shelter is the most brilliant example of how a film can become the history – however singular the viewpoint… And it rocks!
The Good, The Bad and The Ugly features funny, excellent performances, line after line of quotable dialogue and brilliant music and scope.
The Thin Blue Line is a great experimental film. No character captions, no context – but a fuller, more well-defined story is hard to find. Morris makes the audience work really hard, but not one drop of sweat is raised. And the comic-book colour!
Atomic Café is a brilliant commercial messing of experimental found footage and the great traditions found in films such as Frank Capra’s Why We Fight. Shock Pop.
12 Angry Men – what a great cast and brilliant script. Gripping and true.
Triumph of the Will still chills. So enormous in its scope and muscle, it’s a monument to the sheer power of cinema, the ease with which people can be led and what we can become. It’s simply overwhelming in its insights into human nature. Cinema as a weapon has never had a bigger payload.
The General is full of innocence and quiet humanity. It just makes me cry with joy every time I see it.
Night of the Living Dead is still a constant inspiration for me in low-budget filmmaking – and my kids love it.

Close-Up completely obliterates the boundary between fiction and documentary in order to turn the most seductive aspect of cinema upside down. And it also shows how solemn and painful it can be (to want) to be a filmmaker.
Mirror, an attempt at a cinematic autobiography, ends up as a story about the main character’s relationship with himself. If – following the usual method of film watching – we identify with the protagonist, then the film becomes a meditation on our own relationship with ourselves: narrative cinema brought full circle to its point zero. 
 Although The Girl Chewing Gum is a short film, this Oberhausen winner humorously reveals filmmaking and film directing as a ridiculously preposterous endeavour.
Camera Buff reveals filmmaking as a process entangled in a deeply complex moral maze, in which it is not always easy to maintain one’s sanity. The filmmaker ends up as a devastated and lost loser.
If the world of theatre stands in in Opening Night for that of film – which would not be much of an interpretational stretch in this gem directed by the most independent of all the American filmmakers – then the lives of those making them is hell, with only thin but blissful possibilities of redemption. 
Numéro deux is an unprecedented attempt by an acclaimed director to begin his career again, employing video long before anyone else – a filmmaker trying to find himself through his work.
Mulholland Dr. thrives effortlessly on the idea that films can reverse time and turn interpretations upside down, while its filmmaker character is a lost, self-obsessed arse.
I Even Met Happy Gypsies proves that cinema can reveal things that up to that point had been unseen. It portrays a marginalised group constantly watching and squabbling over a television set – an ersatz world that appears to be better then their reality.
Arnulf Rainer is a short, structuralist documentary that reduces cinema to four of its basic elements – light, dark, silence, noise – thus easily demonstrating that there is beauty in film apart from narrative and representation, which are here completely eliminated.

Mulligan may be a one-hit wonder, but To Kill a Mockingbird is a movie that I want my children to see. One of the best novel adaptations ever made, and Atticus Finch is the definition of a true hero. Rafelson and Nicholson worked together many times but Five Easy Pieces is definitely their best. It’s also a groundbreaking movie of the 1970s. With The Godfather: Part II, Coppola may be the only director who surpassed his own masterpeace. Even without Marlon Brando.

Should I go with Man With a Movie Camera or Battleship Potemkin (or maybe Happiness)? I went with Man With a Movie Camera. I recently saw it at Dokufest in Prizren, Kosovo, in the cinema – called River without Name, which is literally in the river – and I must say, the film still flows. 
Should I go with Casablanca or The Third Man (or maybe Detour)? I went with Casablanca. Here, all is said and done by people who were born to say and do precisely that. 
Should I go with Psycho or Persona (or maybe Flaming Creatures)? I went with Psycho. It still has a future. 
Should I go with Fires on the Plain or Seven Samurai (or maybe Ugetsu)? I went with Fires on the Plain. With this film the (old) world ended in 1959. (A new one started via Psycho and Breathless – and they were both based on movies, not on the ‘real world’). 
Should I go with La Jétee or La Règle du jeu (or maybe Alphaville)? I went with La Jétee. The thing that happened to that boy happens to me – and I guess to everybody – each time I watch movies (yeah, flicks are funerals, not festivities). 
Should I go with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Paisan (or maybe La dolce vita)? I went with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It’s the only film that could go on forever (without losing a reason for going on forever). 
Should I go with The Wild Bunch or The Searchers (or High Noon)? I went with The Wild Bunch. I saw it in 1971, just before I hit 11, in Logatec, a small town in Slovenia with a cinema and nothing else. What were the chances that I would not take it with me wherever I went? 
Should I go with The Godfather or Nashville (or maybe Chinatown)? I went with The Godfather. I could go with Nashville or Chinatown, but the sequels to those two were so bad. 
Should I go with Blade Runner or Metropolis (or 2001: A Space Odyssey)? I went with Blade Runner. No apologies: Metropolis and 2001: A Space Odyssey are only dreaming that they’re Blade Runner. 
And finally, should I go with Reservoir Dogs or No Country for Old Men (or Oldboy)? I went with Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino was a hope: was there ever a better defender of the idea that film history is not a failed project? Oh, and the whole idea of debating movies – and shortlisting them – while killing and dying and realising that your survival depends on the number of films you’ve seen? Doesn’t Reservoir Dogs – a film about the shortlisting of film history – exactly prove how painful and deadly the shortlisting of film history can be? 
But alas, when I came to the end of my shortlisting of film history, I realised that I had lost Citizen Kane, even though I’m willing to admit that Citizen Kane is the ‘greatest film ever’ for obvious reasons: Citizen Kane is the only film that fits the genre of ‘the greatest film ever’ – the only film that was made to be ‘the greatest film ever’ and that was marketed and publicised as such, because it was, as we well know, the only way for Orson Welles and his film to survive the onslaught of the offended William Randolph Hearst’s publishing empire."

A friend, catching me in a moment of paralysis engendered by this task (which requires a mind-boggling combination of examined sentiment, ruthlessness and caprice), suggested that I narrow down my sprawling shortlist by selecting those films that might function as paragons of some genre, movement, national cinema or other larger body of work. But as I narrowed away I saw rather the opposite tendency emerge: I was compelled toward selecting those films that seemed above all singular, films that didn’t fit well in their ostensible niches, films that didn’t easily lend themselves to comparisons, that didn’t necessarily stand for anything greater — films that seemed to be the greatest at nothing so much as just being themselves. These are the films that stain the psyche, speak both to history and to their respective moment, that break something open that can’t be repaired.
I like very much that so many of these films are, to an unusual extent, dependent on a central performance of some utterly peculiar, mutant kind of genius: Irène Jacob, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, little Ana Torrent (perhaps most of all). Perversely, because it stings me to think of it, I also like that these ten films do not represent the work of my most beloved directors, nor those directors whose names would appear on an analogous top ten of all time list. (Many such directors have a body of work that’s far more important and interesting than any single, ‘perfect’ film – the best example of this, and for me the most painful absence from my list, being Luis Buñuel. Likewise, no single film noir is as fascinating as the whole of film noir.) All of these films continue to give me pleasure and to offer discoveries. All are exceedingly personal. All remain deeply strange to me."

It is a list of animated films, chosen at a particular cultural moment. Because one thing that the ‘digital’ in cinema nowadays reveals, and makes undeniable, is animation’s potential – as technique, as form, and as concept – to not merely refine but to explode what ‘cinema’ can be and what it can mean."

The few changes reflect what I have seen and reseen since and the research I did for documentaries I’ve made on filmmakers. Thus, Renoir steps in for Powell and Pressburger, Von Sternberg replaces Von Stroheim. But ten is too short a list – so many great filmmakers (Bresson, Mizoguchi, Ophüls, Kubrick, Hawks, Bergman, Buñuel, to name just a few) have to be left off, partly because it’s so hard to choose just one film from their complete works. Therefore a choice is impossibly selective, and in my case conceived perhaps with a nod to the dream element of cinema (and I could certainly dream about Louise Brooks for a long time). Chimes rather than Kane? It just has such a great heart (and Shakespeare). If I really have to choose one title, it remains the one by Vigo, for his deeply moving and poetic sense of just about everything cinema can offer. It’s also one of sexiest films ever made. Curiously, L’Atalante dropped off the ten greatest list last time round; I hope I can help return it to its rightful place."
Kristin Thompson,413,https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/413,academic,US,Female,critics poll,"Honorary fellow, University of Wisconsin-Madison",10,"Making up a list of ten films to constitute the pinnacle of world cinema means, to a considerable extent, choosing the greatest directors and picking one film to represent each. To me, the greatest directors are Tati, Ozu, and Eisenstein. For Tati and Eisenstein, the best films are clear to me. For Ozu, there could be any of at least half a dozen films plausibly chosen for this list, but Late Spring happens to be my favourite. 
Inevitably there are other films that I much regret not being able to include on the list, such as Seven Samurai, Trouble in Paradise, His Girl Friday, Sjöström’s The Phantom Carriage and Capellani’s Germinal. (The silent era is too little represented in previous polls, but restorations by archives and retrospectives at specialist film festivals make this lack easier to remedy.) Had Orson Welles’s The Magnificent Ambersons not been re-cut by RKO, it would probably be on my list.
There are other directors who should be represented here, most notably Bresson, Mizoguchi and Godard. Their work is so consistent, however, that I simply cannot choose a single masterpiece by any of them.
I felt that a film more recent than 1974 (The Godfather Part II, the latest film represented on previous S&S lists) should be included. The last four decades of film history have surely seen the release of at least one worthy film, but the vast expansion of production in smaller countries and the international exhibition of such films in festivals have rendered it more difficult than ever for critics to agree upon a single candidate. It remains easier to vote for the established classics. My choice of a film that deserves to be watched and rewatched decades from now, as we currently watch such films as La Règle du jeu, is Through the Olive Trees ( or Under the Olive Trees, to give a more accurate translation than the usual).

",10,"Behind the Green Door is a hypnotic and pivotal landmark in pornographic cinema that contains enough memorable occurrences both onscreen and off to keep its impact & legacy alive for future generations. I watched this in a museum in San Francisco and throughout it could feel the eyes of my literary idol Bill Landis (Sleazoid Express) watching me watch strangers fuck.
My Dad walked in on my friend and I watching Boarding House one afternoon and wanted to know why we were watching gay porn on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. We weren’t. But you could make a case that if it looks like a duck and quacks like duck, it is a duck. From an opening that makes Snow’s Wavelength looks positively Crankesque to the delirious poolside performance by Kalassu, Boarding House is a very unique film. Well, using the term film is being generous. It’s more like someone listened to some New Wave, ate a lot of junk food, took acid, then tried to swallow leopard skin briefs before finally throwing up inside a single-tube camera and transferring the whole mess to 35mm. Like the tape in RINGU, once you watch BH it creeps into your consciousness and starts to pogo on your soul. It’s a truly remarkable film that never reveals its real identity, no matter how much ugly surface you strip away. Just when you think the whole thing is one giant prank, some inanimate object floats by for no reason. It whispers to you to delve deeper and so you do. Deeper and deeper until the lead actor enters your dreams, dancing in his leopard skin, enticing you in to an embrace as the soundtrack licks your eardrums with its incessant breath-beat “hah hah hah”.
I once told someone if I ever found a woman who loved Dead Ringers as much as I, I’d marry her. Well, the one I eventually married only said “eeeewwwww” when I explained the plot. Initially I found it to be too calculated and cold, but after I walked out into the brisk air of George St in Sydney, I never stopped thinking about it. Over the years, I’ve revisited it numerous times and, substituting sleep deprivation with Dea Ringer’s drug addiction, I now feel like the third brother to Elliot and Bev (“they’re triplets my dear”) as I sleepily wander thru our house in dressing gown and slippers.
As a programmer one of the joys is the voyeuristic and egotistical rush you get when an audience connects and commits to a film like none before. I screened Drunken Master 2 to an amped-up but unaware festival audience that responded to the kinetic displays as if someone had dropped live scorpions in their underwear. Purists will argue for more deserving titles from the rich history of Hong Kong cinema but for me there is Drunken Master 2, sitting legs above shoulders and all the others. It is not merely a phenomenal action pic, it is entertainment of the highest order.
Emperor of the North is an outstanding Depression-era hobo epic that knocks you off your feet and chains you to its undercarriage for one sweet ride through America’s lush northwest. It makes fast friends with the appearance of a sharp ’n’ weary Marvin and immediately doubles down with the appearance of moon-faced Borgnine smashing bones and hurling abuse. Sometimes you can’t fathom why certain films resonate with you so much. Others won’t feel the same and may dismiss it as lesser effort from a consistently strong director. I can’t argue. All I know is that it works for me. “A-No-1” is damn right.
Harold and Maude is a timeless film that should date but doesn’t. There’s a scene set in a hospital near the end that’s virtually silent. We finally see Bud Cort’s Harold drop his dry facade, then rev up to anger before suddenly collapsing in soft heap of sadness. It’s the moment when you realise that you’ve been deeply affected by the lives of two oddballs and it will be a film you’ll revisit the rest of your life.
There have been many who have crashed into the pedestal but none have managed to ever knock Pink Flamingos, Waters’ pinnacle of poor taste, from its rightful place at the top. All the rest are poseurs. Waters would be happy with the analogy, but seeing Flamingos for the first time is like when Reagan/JFK/Insert your icon was killed: you remember exactly where you were when you saw Divine eat the shit. The ultimate midnight movie, it still manages to feel like it’s been sent from a parallel earth run by the weirdos we all knew in high school. But there’s something strangely sweet about all the depravity on display as well. It’s like the baby that shits in your face – how can you not love it?
The Naked Prey is primal filmmaking from one of the few successful Hollywood actor-to-director transformations. Wilde unleashes the beast within and casts aside Hollywood artifice (and his khakis) in a terrific meditation on one man’s survival in deep Africa. From the outlandish punishment scenarios initiated by the avenging tribe (my favourite? the human hotpot), to the thunderous beginning of the human hunt, this is savage filmmaking at its finest.
My teenage years were full of memorable quotes and songs from The Wanderers. Everyone shines here, from Ken Wahl’s slickly confident Richie to John Friedrich’s bullied son Joey, from Alan Rosenberg’s wiseass Turkey to Karen Allen’s incredibly sexy Nina. All were stars in the making. Kaufman’s sprawling and energetic coming–of-age pic, based on Richard Price’s slim novel, delivers so much that you’ll overlook its faults. It can be messy, loud and loose, but so is growing up. It manages to capture the truth of great friendships, a rare and beautiful thing in the sometimes contrived world of film.

For a long time Lawrence of Arabia was a secret film for Soviet citizens, about a hero of mystery. Everyone knew about this film but nobody saw it.

This ability to access one’s subconscious mind is a prerequisite of change – changing the viewer’s point of view, his/her state of mind, disproving one’s prejudice, opening his/her eyes etc. The greatest films all do that: they have the power to change things, and as a film theorist and critic one can spend hundreds of challenging, yet rewarding hours trying to discover how exactly this change was conducted and executed. 
As you probably already noticed, there is one Estonian film on the list as well (surely, at the time it was made, Ukuaru was considered part of the Soviet film tradition). It shouldn’t come as a surprise for Sight & Sound readers, but I am pretty sure it does. Leida Laius studied in Moscow with Otar Iosseliani, Larisa Shepitko and lots of other significant Soviet filmmakers, and was taught by Gerassimov, Romm, Kuleshov, Dovzhenko and so on. Excellent melodrama, wonderful acting and smart editing go hand in hand with Arvo Pärt’s original score, which includes the famous ‘Ukuaru Waltz’, to make Ukuaru one the greatest Estonian films of all time.

With the exception of Marker’s inexhaustible master text —the first among equals on this particular roll — any of a half-dozen or more titles could have easily stood next to these names, as could any of the honourable runners-up (Pialat, Jancsó, Olmi, Pasolini, Ozu, Keaton, the Dardennes etc). Yet it is ultimately the names, rather than the works, that we assess when engaged in these exercises, I think. If the work is at least somewhat tangible, measurable and rankable, the name (as distinct from the actual person who bears it) points towards something larger: a certain idea of cinema that is concocted or wished for by us almost as much as by the bearer of that name – the work, no less so than a list of works, only fleetingly and imperfectly incarnates. If these exercises have any real purpose, it’s less to arrive at any impossible consensus than to give transitory form to those ideas we bear, or that perhaps are borne through us; after all, as one of the names on this list once remarked, we don’t think at the cinema but are thought."

To be an artist means not to be superficial. It is very rare to find a true artist who entertains but is not superficial.

Rossellini’s revolution, as well as Renoir’s or De Sica’s, was simple: to turn everything upside down. One example from Rome Open City is enough to prove it: in the scene of Pina’s death, Rossellini was able to create a modern ‘Pietà’, sculpting the air better than Michelangelo with marble and putting a woman’s body where Christ’s body traditionally lies. Everything is upside down. Forever.
City lights has the best ending in the history of movies, a perfect conclusion to a perfect film.
Murnau, while in the mould of modern expressionism, has his roots in romanticism. Like Pabst, Lang seems abstract but he is human, too human. The wonderful A Song of Two Humans is a visionary hymn to the passion and tragedy of the heart.
Is surrealism outside reality, or is in fact true reality? And is so-called reality real or an illusion? The poor boys of The Young and the Damned will disappear without a sound, like insects, like shadows. Like them, our piety will disappear forever from our hearts. Is it real? Is it a nightmare?

We cannot forget the lessons of the masters of Japanese cinema: Mizoguchi, Kurosawa and Ozu. To choose between their different masterpieces is very hard: perhaps the best way to glorify such a complex cosmos is to pay attention to a microcosmos, remembering the ‘simplest’ Japanese movie Tokyo Story – pure, tragic and moving, like the song of a lark in the dawn.
To shoot a movie that is like real life: without a cut. The director is like God: his creation lives without him. This has the dream of geniuses such as Hitchcock or Dreyer, but nobody but Angelopoulos was able to achieve it properly. His magnificent movie The Travelling Players, composed of 80 long takes, is a solemn, extraordinary classic tragedy rewritten for our tragic century.

One could pick any one of ten titles by Ozu (except the great but not standout Tôkyô monogatari), but I have chosen The Only Son because it exemplifies the director’s sensitivities to the local and the transcendent. No film has a better instinct for local Tokyo in 1936 – the social textures and personal imperatives of its vernacular time and place. No work survives better as a major, if instinctive expression of early Showa-era Japan in the 1930s – the tragic cultural and historical context its characters are trapped in – without either them or its maker realising it.

Ten near misses (in alphabetic order):
City Girl (F.W. Murnau, 1930): As the greatest achievement of silent cinema.
Duck Amuck (Chuck Jones, 1953): It wasn’t the first time the fourth wall had been pierced in cinema, but it’s how Termite Terrace punched it out.
The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz (Luis Buñuel, 1956): Perhaps the greatest of Buñuel’s films because he does the most programmatic job of filmmaking work – and it is thus the most subversive.
The Warped Ones (Kurahara Koreyoshi, 1960) tied with Pierrot le fou (Jean-Luc Godard, 1965): As the twin major expressions of New Wave – a youth not wasted on the young, but which we can still never go back to.
Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (William Wyler, 1944). Because – besides its historic record and the means and risk by which it was recorded – of its architectonics of objects in flight. For this it was more influential on special effects than 2001: a Space Odyssey.
Pickpocket (Robert Bresson, 1960): As with Ozu, one could pick any film, but perhaps it should be Pickpocket as the exemplar of cinema naturalism without the burden of realism.
La Région centrale (Michael Snow, 1971): The definitive structuralist work and therefore essential to defining the possibilities of what structure is in cinema.
Saikaku ichidai onna (The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi Kenji, 1952).
Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976): The one work of New Hollywood that stands the tests of time and achievement.
Four footnotes on this process and this selection are essential, at least from where I stand.
1. For the half-century that this poll has been cometing around global screen culture, the central tension in its process, and in the ebb and flow of its ranking, has always been between giving way to taste and coolly assessing influence. It’s the choice between Orson’s Welles’ first two, Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons. In the first bloom of cinephilic passion, I’d have backed the former. A decade or so on, I’d have backed the later as the superior work of the filmmaker’s filmography. These days, I still see the latter as the superior work, but a greater responsibility to historical forces than to my taste compels me to acknowledge Kane’s influence over Ambersons’ far less stable brilliance. That said, I have completely failed to follow this principle cogently or systematically. Sometimes the choices based on influence will seem as obscurely personal as those choices that are completely made on the grounds of taste (the argument for Wyler’s Memphis Belle would exemplify this).
2. I’m sure I’m not alone in some choices really concealing namechecking. Half a dozen titles could be substituted for tiles nominated from the body of work of directors such as Ozu or Ophüls.
3. For the first time, however, I felt the need to throw Hitchcock into the canonical dustbin. I did that to Chaplin and Kubrick many years ago.
4. For those of us who are the product of minor national cinema cultures there will always be an amount of mourning involved in this process (that’s unless they are entirely free of local national sentiment and what Australians call “cultural strut”). This needs to be pointed out to our Anglo-American cousins and others. I deeply mourn that – in all good conscience – I cannot offer an Australian national classic as among the world’s greatest works of cinema, no matter how deep my chauvinist passions or deep fondness for individual titles or filmmakers. I should be able to. I should be able to at least say that only for the most part is this list a tribute to the genius of other national cultures and their colonisation of my local screen culture and national imagination, but surely not totally?
But in truth it’s our colonial imaginative yoke is total. We had one of the first truly national, colloquial cinemas, but we were also one of the first to give it away, around 1913. We then had 60 years of capital investment strike by our major media business and an anti-nationalist government policy. As a result, the screen culture and economy of those times tended to reward hucksterism rather than understanding genuine creative potential when the odd independent filmmaking impulse did emerge. And as another result, we sadly lack even the modest compensation of a one-off, standout, iconic, foundling who is an internationally known national auteur, as Bergman was for Swedish cinema or Ray for Bengali cinema.
For all the achievements of the last 40 years (and the less well-known ones that preceded the 1970s, such as the work of Raymond Longford or Cecil Holmes), Australian cinema still tends to never be quite memorable or canonical. There’s still a native caution in narrative, style and investment, and too much misunderstanding of our own natural talents.
Perhaps the emergence of new indigenous filmmakers (Warwick Thornton, Ivan Sen) might change this by 2022?"

Such a gallery must be personal, but mine does contain a theme that feels timely to me: journeys of various kinds that connect the personal and the historical, the national and the global, with an increasing lack of triumphalism. In my view, one element that makes these films so durable is, oddly, their strong attachment to their own era. In their specific manner of being dated rather than timeless, they project the feeling that, as Alain Robbe-Grillet put it in From Realism to Reality, “in truth everything is constantly changing and there is always something new.” New technologies might seem to threaten the empire of ‘film’ but many of these productions also suggest the unpredictable formats that emerge during moments of bewildering change."

The films by Tarkovsky, Antonioni, Resnais and Kurosawa are all landmarks in the reinvention of cinematic language, and continue to inspire filmmakers to date. 
Bergman’s Fanny and Alexander may be the most appreciated of his films, but the lavish setting, the rich colours and textures paired with suffocating atmosphere and the rigour of Chekhov’s plays make Cries and Whispers the most outstanding of his works. Kubrick’s, Tarr’s and Lynch’s metaphysical ventures through time and space into the human psyche haven’t failed to mesmerise moviegoers and academics alike throughout the years. With Hidden Haneke took both the thriller genre and the role of a filmmaker in the narrative to a whole new level and made this racially engaged chiller as unsettling as it could get. When it comes to secret desires, quiet longings, little obsessions and unrequited love, no one does them better than Wong Kar-Wai, the Hong Kong master of genre-bending melodramas.

Sixty-odd years after the release of Citizen Kane, Welles’ debut feature looks as fresh and vital as ever. With the help of movie veterans like Greg Toland, Welles broke rules he didn’t even know existed and vastly expanded the language of cinema.
Akira Kurosawa’s majestic account of a village that hires a motley crew of samurai to defend it from bandit raids is so fluent and visually powerful that the subtitles become incidental.
Orson Welles described The General as “the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made”, and he wasn’t wrong. The vision, clarity and economy with which Keaton tells his story are remarkable.
Yasujiro Ozu’s masterpiece Tokyo Story has appeared on your top ten lists before and deservedly so. His film memorably depicts the growing pains of postwar Japan, and the mutual incomprehension of two elderly rural parents and their go-ahead, westernised children.
Packed with unforgettable scenes and images, Ingmar Bergman’s utterly unique 1957 film examined his complex attitudes to religion and morality, but what surprises me most rewatching it is how funny it is.
My favourite Truffaut film and my favourite coming-of-age movie, Les Quatre cent coups is comparable to James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in its insightful depiction of the awakening of an artistic sensibility.
Made for half-nothing, Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali is among the most seamless and graceful movies ever made, the best of the Apu Trilogy and a stunning achievement.
Antonioni’s L’Avventura has the kind of plotline that gives arthouse cinema a bad name, but somehow a lacklustre search for a young woman who’s gone missing on a small volcanic island becomes an existential investigation of the human condition. Every time you watch it, you notice something new.
My only vaguely controversial choice is Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon. I wanted to include something worthy that was made after 1970! And while I’ve found some of his films hugely problematic, I think Haneke is extremely gifted when he gets it right, and The White Ribbon is a beautifully constructed masterpiece. In it he uses a seemingly idyllic German village on the eve of the First World War to investigate the origins not just of fascism but of the profound human impulse towards violence and terrorism, and the endless battle between civilisation and nihilism."

For the way narrative, conspiracy and game slowly seep in at the edges of docudrama normality in Rivette’s fabulous and frightening half day. For the airy mystery of Antonioni’s globetrotting ‘thriller’, in which Jack Nicholson’s jaded political reporter loses himself between the treacherously beguiling folds of a narrative. For Renoir’s immortal exploration of light, depth, changing weather and the sensuous heaviness of bodies – so casual, tender and tragic.
For Pierrot le fou’s doomed utopianism, its yearning referentiality, its blithe incursions into musical or slapstick in the South of France; for ideas going off like firecrackers; for its space, sound and colour. For the Tex-Mex melodies swelling up out of the desert, for Dean Martin pouring the liquor back into the bottle; for its jailhouse singalong; for the eternally appealing Hawksian view of friendship. For Apichatpong’s updated day in the country, the cinema’s newest deadly strain of vaccine-less intoxication.
And Vertigo for its endlessly rewatchable mystery, its excavation of an old, weird San Francisco and the oneiric pull of its misty light; for the admission that we remake the ones we love to match our desire; for Scotty insisting that one shouldn’t be so sentimental.

I think they all expand something about cinema: they don’t merely fill an existing form with content. They also expand something for the viewer in the dimension of feeling. Each uses the medium of film to produce a sense both of the material situations of their protagonists and, simultaneously, of the emotional and spiritual subtleties of their interactions, which transcend and yet are rooted in the material world. Film itself carries us to places and emotions – these films show how they are connected and move us through new ground in both."

To me, great movies withstand time, and I believe that not only are all these movies still relevant and accessible to a modern audience, they are also all exemplary in their use of film grammar. Some admissions: 1) not being able to squeeze in Night Of The Hunter (1955) has perhaps caused me the most pain; 2) the poll’s rules made me drop Ivan The Terrible Part 2, with its extraordinary colour scenes; and 3) bypassing Citizen Kane for Touch Of Evil is arguably the one purely personal and idiosyncratic choice (though The Red Shoes is really my favourite film by Powell and Pressburger, Colonel Blimp is a film that only seems to get stronger with passing years – which is saying something). All of these films have size, scope and ambition, so, If nothing else, I believe a film student who’d only ever seen these ten would be duty-bound to make something interesting."

Charulata is elegant and sophisticated filmmaking at its best.
In Faces, reality transforms and transcends art.
After a long exile, Renoir celebrated his return with the vivacious colours and movements of French Cancan – not to mention the unforgettable Gabin.
Late Spring is the crystallisation of eternal loneliness.
At once human and serene, attached and detached, The Puppetmaster is history/History told à la HHH.
Spring in a Small Town is an aesthetically a sublime merging of the modern and the traditional.

Citizen Kane is a perennial favourite, but its pioneering use of deep focus photography and its introduction of Orson Welles to the world of cinema means that it simply cannot be ignored.
Almost any one of Roeg’s works from 1969 to 1980 could have made my list but Don’t Look Now, a chilling adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s supernatural tale, continues to grow in stature. The photography, performances and unique imagistic style are terrific. 
Earth is a poetic hymn to nature and a feast for the eyes. A breathtakingly beautiful work.
All the hardships and cruelties of a working class childhood condensed into Kes’ 113 sublime minutes. 
Nosferatu is the most poetic of all horror films, with a mesmerising performance from Max Schreck as the sexually rapacious count. 
Salo is a genuinely subversive work. Certain of its images and ideas constantly replay across my mind, though sometimes I wish they wouldn’t.
The Spirit of the Beehive is a powerful political parable and a haunting mood piece that once seen is never forgotten. 
Sunset Boulevard is one of Wilder’s finest achievements and a suitably scabrous and cynical account of tinseltown. 
Three Colours: Red is the Polish director’s conclusion to his Three Colours Trilogy. This final film dips into interconnecting lives to deliver a powerful, flawless mediation on faith, destiny and contemporary existence.

The cinema still had a sparkling glory in the 1960s and 1970s, when I was a college student. In those days, young fans would always make a weekly visit to a film theatre near their home. All the seats were full and many people had to stand, huge roars of applause breaking out, especially at a lot of so-called Ninkyo films (modern versions of traditional Samurai dramas). The directors, or film craft artists, began to produce pictures with a novel approach that was based on their original aesthetic sense.
The ATG (Art Theater Guild) actively introduced excellent European films to Japan. People were surprised and impressed to find a European sense of beauty, which they had never found in American films. And moreover, I would like to add two distinguished documentary films, which were not shown in commercial theatres but were independently and enthusiastically shown in local facilities all over Japan."

So I think my list will be a bit mainstream, but these are the most important films in my life.
There is nothing more scary then the monsters you can only see in your imagination, but Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi and co managed to pull off the impossible in Alien: when they finally show their creature, it didn’t just meet but exceeded our fears.
Anchorman provided thousands and thousands of pub quotes. It was trendsetting, refreshingly absurd and unbelievably funny, and said much about the time and place in which it was made.
Duel is not just one of the greatest movie metaphors (machines kill their people), for me it’s the greatest suspense thriller ever. The claustrophobic shots are a masterclass.
After the most successful film ever made, Lucas pulled off a very daring, very dark sequel in The Empire Strikes Back. It’s so alive, with an ending so shocking I almost fainted.
With Miller’s Crossing the Coens made a musical gangster satire so complex it even gave those geniuses writer’s block (which they made into Barton Fink, another masterpiece).
Jim Jarmusch and his little stories of drama and comedy in Night On Earth are like life itself. It’s so natural that I imagined myself into the backseat of these taxis. This is pure movie magic, and much better than any special effects.
Once Upon a Time in the West is an elegy about the death of men and their principles, the dying breath of an era and a genre orchestrated to the sound of a harmonica.
The Terminator is supposed to be a B movie, with lots of action and some sex, but it turned out to be a mindboggling and thought-provoking experience, with such dynamism and speed that the film seemed like time travel itself.
The Thing is not just a monster movie with unbelievably good effects but one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, presenting a fresh allegory about a disease hiding in men called AIDS. (Is the Thing a leaving, breathing creature or just a virus?)
The greatest trick The Usual Suspects ever played is that you can rewatch it over and over and still not know whether Keyser Soeze really exists or is just a myth. A very rewarding film indeed.
So there it is, my favorite ten films of all time – not the groundbreaking ones, not the tentpoles, just the films and movies that made me a film fanatic."

First, in order to be considered as one of the greatest, movies should always look for new ways of cinematic expression or should try to analyse, to reflect on the problems, possibilities and boundaries of representation. Second, it is also important that it doesn’t become a purely formal innovation, so it should also be able to have an emotional and/or intellectual effect on its viewer through its thematic content – it should deal with relevant issues. And the third criteria is about a film’s contemporaneity in 2012: I chose films that didn’t seem outdated, obsolete neither in their formal or thematic treatment, irrespective of their year of production."
