# Sight & Sounds Poll Data
Data from the _Sound & Sound_ polls of the greatest films of all time conducted every decade.

For the 2012 poll, here is the time it took for me to scrape:
- the data of 1,205 voters (directors and critics) [726 KB]
- the data of the all 12,060 votes [1.26 MB]

```bash
$ time python3 voters_2012.py

real    19m9.783s
user    2m9.181s
sys     0m7.681s
```

More documentation forthcoming.
